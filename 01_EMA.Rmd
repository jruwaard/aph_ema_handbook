Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has many aliases. It is known as 'Experience Sampling' [@Larson1983], 'Ambulatory Assessment' [@EbnerPriemer2009] or 'Ambulatory Self-reporting' [@Conner2012a], 'Real-time Data Capturing', the 'Continuous Unified Electronic Diary Method' [@EllisDavies2012], and as the 'Intensive-longitudinal Study Design' [@Bolger2013]. The different terms stress different aspects of EMA research. All, however, refer to research methods that involve the *repeated sampling of people's current thoughts, emotions, behaviour, physiological states, and context, in their natural environment, typically (but not necessary) via electronic wearable devices* [@Shiffman2008].

### Active versus Passive EMA
\index{EMA!Passive EMA} \index{EMA!Observational EMA|see{Passive EMA}}
\index{EMA!Active EMA} \index{EMA!Self-report EMA|see{Active EMA}}

In EMA research, two forms of data collection are distinguished: 1) 'Active EMA', with which *self-report* data are collected, and 2) 'Passive EMA', with which *observational* data are collected. Active EMA requires participants to consciously provide information, for example by rating their current mood in response to a question that is prompted on their smartphone (see Figure \@ref(fig:fig01a)). In passive EMA, information is collected through wearables or log files without active involvement of participants, for example on heart-rate, activity, smartphone use or engagement on social media (see Figure \@ref(fig:fig01b)).Studies may combine active and passive EMA. A study into sleep patterns, for example, may involve both a self-report sleep diary and an accelerometer sensor [@Meijden2016].

### EMA sampling
\index{Sampling!Signal-contingent}
\index{Sampling!Event-contingent} 
\index{Sample plan|see{Sampling}}

EMA is further typified by the way in which data sampling is triggered. EMA sampling may be triggered by a signal (signal-contingent sampling), an event (event-contingent sampling), or a combination of both [@Conner2012b]. 

In *signal-contingent sampling*, participants respond to questions when they are prompted to do so by a signal (or 'beeps', as these signals are often called in the literature). In *event-contingent sampling*, study participants complete an assessment whenever a specific event occurs, such as a panic attack or alcohol consumption. 

Signal-contingent sampling can follow a fixed or a random scheme. In a fixed scheme, participants are prompted at fixed time-points, for example at 9:30, 12:30, and 16:30. In a random scheme, prompts are sent at random time points, typically in pre-set intervals. For example, participants could be prompted to complete two assessments per day, one at a random time point between 10:00 and 14:00, and one at a random time point between 14:00 and 16:00. Using pre-set intervals ensures that participants do not receive several prompts within a limited time-frame [@Piasecki2007]. In addition, it ensures that participants are not bothered by prompts at inappropriate times (e.g., participants may not appreciate prompts after 22:00 and before 7:30).

With 'event-contingent sampling', the sample rate is determined by the occurrence rate of the event. One way to implement this is to simply ask study participants to complete a questionnaire whenever the event occurs. When active EMA is combined with passive EMA, it may be also be possible to trigger event-based prompts automatically based on changes in passive data, for example by triggering an EMA questionnaire automatically whenever a significant change in activity level is detected [@Smyth2003].

## Why EMA?

### To minimize recall bias in assessment

\index{Recall bias}

In clinical research, self-report questionnaires are often used to assess the presence and severity of symptoms in the recent past. While useful, these retrospective self-reports are not without drawbacks, since they tap into the memory of respondents, which can be distorted [@Shiffman2008; @Moore2016]. EMA circumvents this recall bias, by asking participants to rate their *current state*, rather than asking them to reflect on past experiences.


### To increase the ecological validity of research findings

\index{Ecological validity} 

A key feature of EMA is the collection of data in real-world environments, as participants go about their daily activities, as opposed to data collection in controlled labs or research settings [@Shiffman2008]. Thus, EMA data can be expected to result in research findings that have better ecological validity and better generalization to the subjectâ€™s lived experience in real-world settings. Practical applications derived from EMA data are therefore expected to be more relevant to real-life situations.

### To advance ideographic research
\index{Nomothetic research} \index{Ideographic research} 
\index{Intra-individual process|see{Ideographic research}}

In clinical research, a distinction is often made between ideographic and nomothethic methods [@allport1937]. Idiographic methods are those that "aim to identify patterns of behavior within the person across a population of experiences or situations, and nomothetic methods[are] those that aim to identify patterns of behavior across a population of individuals, rather than for any given individual" [@Conner2009].  The difference is important. As is increasingly recognised, group-level findings do not necessarily generalize to the individual members of the group, as shown by Figure \@ref(fig:fig01c) (adapted from @Hamaker2012).

In contrast to more qualitative idiographic methods, such as interviews and N = 1 case studies, EMA allows for the collection of large amounts of quantitative data on the individual level. Thus, EMA offers a quantitative method for *idiographic* research, measuring characteristics of (unique) individuals across time and context [@Shiffman2008]. This allows for a better understanding of intra-individual process, and of the factors that account for variability within and between individuals.

```{r fig01c, fig.asp = .4, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "An illustration of how group-level and individual-level processes can differ dramatically: the relationship between x on y is negative in the group (as shown by the descending regression line), but positive for individuals (marked by ellipses)."}

# simulate individual
sim_p <- function(id = 1, intercept = 0, x_start = 0){
  X <- (0:9)
  Y <- intercept + X * .9 + rnorm(10, 0, 1.5)
  data.frame(id = id, X = X + x_start, Y = Y)
}

# define effect of x on y for the group
intercept <- 100
X <- seq(1, 100, 10)
Y <- 100 - .4 * X 

# let individuals define the group
dt <- NULL
for (i in 1:10) {
  p <- sim_p(i, Y[i], X[i])
  dt <- rbind(dt, p)
}

# plot figure
ggplot(dt, aes(x = X, y = Y, group = id)) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(group = NULL), 
              color = "black", 
              method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(size = 1.2, shape = 16) + 
  stat_ellipse(color = "grey", level = .99, type = "t") + 
  theme_bw(12) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank())
```


## EMA research findings: A birds-eye view

The use of EMA in mental health research might seem novel but this methodology has a long track record. Already in the 1980's, early pioneers used electronic devices to elicit responses from study participants to tap into (mental) health processes in everyday life [see, e.g., @Csikszentmihalyi2014]. Recent years, however, have witnessed a large increase in EMA research. Rapid technological developments, a marked interest in the individual, and a wide recognition of the need to study health-related processes in real-life situations have all contributed to this. 

EMA-based research in mental health has produced an impressive trove of findings that have supported and, sometimes, challenged existing theories on behavior. EMA data, whether collected as self-report or via wearable device/sensor, have diagnostic, monitoring, management, or intervention applications (@Patel2012; @Aung2017; @Evenson2015]. Its feasibility for mental health research is evidenced by its use in observational studies and randomized controlled trials on a wide range of topics and populations. Below, we present a non-exhaustive summary of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of EMA research.

### Active EMA
\index{EMA!Active EMA}

Mood disorders have been well-studied using active EMA methods [@Wenze2010], with several reviews outlining recent findings in depression [@Telford2012; @Wichers2011; @burton2013], anxiety disorders [@Walz2014], and depression/bipolar disorder [@AanhetRot2012]. The potential of EMA for use among young populations showed promising results [@Dubad2018]. Innovations in mobile devices has improved the feasibility and popularity of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) for anxiety and depression [@schueller2017]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of EMIs reported small to medium effects on mental health [@Versluis2016].

EMA appears to be particularly well-suited to examine the role of emotions in the development and maintenance of obesity and eating disorders [@Engel2016]. Meta-analytic results suggest that negative affect, rather than hunger, is associated with binge eating among individuals with eating disorders [@Haedt2011; @Haedt2012]. EMA methods have also significantly contributed to the understanding of the processes that drive substance use, cessation, and relapse, often in contrast with theory-driven studies largely derived from global reports collected through retrospective questionnaires [@Shiffman2009; @Swendsen2016].

### Passive EMA
\index{EMA!Passive EMA}

Objective EMA data collected passively through bio-sensors, smart devices, or context/environmental (e.g. location) has been shown to be a feasible and promising method for the longitudinal monitoring of individuals with affective disorders [@Dogan2017; @kirchner2016]. The potential of passive sensing via smartphone for mental health research are outlined in two reviews, encompassing the assessment of health and well-being [@Cornet2017], and the measuring, understanding, and intervening in mental illness and maintaining mental health [@Aung2017]. A systematic review and meta-analysis on actigraphy reported diurnal variations in activity levels among individuals with depression [@burton2013]. Compared with traditional self-reports, passive sensing was reported to be less intrusive and to result in more accurate data, while providing options for continuous monitoring and feedback. 


### Limitations

While available reviews suggest that EMA is a feasible research method that has the potential to make significant contributions to mental health research, one significant drawback of EMA highlighted in several reviews is the lack of high-quality studies. Other general limitations considered include:
