# EMA instruments {#instruments}

General introduction

Collection of EMA data has come a long way since the written diary. With technological advances, current EMA data are more likely to be collected through smart or wearable devices, connected to the internet. The various methods of EMA are developed often from distinct assessment targets [@Shiffman2008]. For example, a smart device will be useful for collecting data on subjective states or behaviors, whereas wearable devices are more suited to collect physiological data. Other points to consider when deciding on a suitable EMA instrument are briefly listed below.

##General considerations 

Costs new development vs known player

When considering a platform for collecting EMA data, do you choose a platform developed by a known player or consider creating one of your own? Using a currently available platform has its advantages but it might not have the flexibility to meet your research needs.For example, the EMA application might not be adapted to include items specific to your research. If deciding on the creating a new platform, keep in mind of the costs required in terms of time and financial.  

Low-tech vs high-tech

Technology has greatly increased the methods of EMA data collection. Nevertheless, it is worth considering whether your study needs to hve an advanced metods of data collection. Maybe the humble written diary is sufficient for your study needs or that the you might still go ahead with the modern, more technologically advanced methods.    

Access to back-office 

An important consideration when deciding on an EMA platform is the autonomy available to the researcher to define and decide on research items. In other words, is there access to the back office? For example, some EMA platforms do allow configuration or customization to the needs of the researcher. Also some back office offer advisory services to researchers when adating items. Using EMA to collect depression data does not mean the wholesale transportation of a validated paper questionnaire onto the EMA platform. It is not similar to conducting an online questionnaire.

Validation, reliability (noise)

Questions can also arise regarding the validity of EMA. Items used in subjective EMA have often not undergone rigorous psychometric testing, unlike traditional paper questionnaires. Also, EMA software are developed using algorithms which are not known or unavailable to the researcher to test for validity.


Access to data

If planning on using a commercial EMA platform, it is important to clarify whether the researcher has access to the raw data or is the data aggregated before provision to the researcher (e.g. genactiv versus fitbit). If the researcher has access to the raw data, how easily accessible is the data? Could the data be downloaded directly from the server of the EMA platform? 


Demands on time     

Subjective EMA could be burdensome to participants as data is collected multiple times a day for an extended period. In order to ensure continued participation, it is important that researchers have in place procedures and resources to manage study participants. Besides preparing a study protocol, it is also necessary to have a manual on how to operate the EMA device. Considerable time also needs to be invested for the training of participants; how EMA and the device works. The researcher might also have to factor in the time needed to contact the participant when data collection starts (e.g. the following day after start of study) to address possible problems, and after data collection (e.g. a debriefing).  


##Technical considerations

Internet access

Is access to internet or wifi an integral part of the collection process? For example, the EMA platform does not offer an app but sends an alert with a link to complete an online survey. If there is an app available, would the data collected collected be stored locally on a device before being uploaded to the paltform server when in the vicitnity of internet access or wifi?  

Device limitations



  Storage (local, cloud, etc)
  Data sharing (wifi, usb etc)
  Server (where, who owns the server/data)
  Battery life

Pilot (on your own phone)

## Participant perspective
Social environment participant, stigma
Impact 
Carrying the device (remembering to take it with you)
Charging battery



## Points to consider

-Internet access 
- whether company has an app or is notification for completion of survey via an email or SMS.
-Use of participants’ own device (fitness device, tablet, smartphone) or designated device 
– issues of software updates, compatibility issues if using participants device, issues of storage capacity of device if data has to be stored locally (because of lack of internet access) before it can be uploaded to central system.
-Issue of “stigma” of participating in an EMA study e.g. need to explain the carrying/wearing of a device that might not complement participants’ look/lifestyle.
