# Acknowledgements {-}
We would like to thank the APH consortium, for giving us the opportunity to write this book, by granting us one of the 2017 APH mental health research funds.

We also thank the APH researchers, who we spoke with during the project, for sharing their knowledge, experience and insights. We are also indebted to the researchers who contributed data, analyses scripts, and other materials that are presented in this book.

Finally, we like to thank the project advisors, Prof. Dr. Heleen Riper and Prof. Dr. Johannes Smit, for their valuable support and input.
