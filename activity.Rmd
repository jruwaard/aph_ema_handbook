# Activity {#activity}

The objective study of human physical activity is one of the exciting opportunities created by passive EMA [@Marszalek2014]. Through technological advances in mobile sensing, we are now able to continuously monitor (in-)activity of participants in every-day life, with little to no participant burden. While questions remain with regard to the validity, reliability and clinical utility of passive EMA with regard to various aspects of activity, such as (disturbed) sleep, sedentary behavior, and energy expenditure [see, e.g., @Feehan2018, @Gomersall2016], an increasing number of mental health studies are including activity tracking devices to better understand sleep habits, circadian rhythm disorders and depression [see, e.g., @Saeb2015, @Saunders2016, @Tahmasian2013].

In this chapter, we will discuss two passive EMA methods to assess physical activity: actigraphy and geotracking. Of these two, actigraphy has been used most in human clinical research. However, due to the massive adoption of smartphones, researchers increasingly collect geolocation data as well, inspired perhaps by the elaborate geolocation data analysis techniques that have been developed in the past decades in wildlife telemetry research [@tomkiewicz2010global].

## Actigraphy
\index{Actigraphy} 
\index{Accelerometer} 

Accelerometers are micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) that measure changes in velocity, typically simultanously on the vertical (Y), horizontal right-left (X) and horizontal front-back axis (Z). Through actigraphy, we can study the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity. 

Figure \@ref(fig:genea-one-hour) shows one hour of data collected from a wrist-worn GENEActive accelerometer. As can be seen, three accelerometers (X, Y, Z) were simultanously providing data. Data were sampled with a frequency of 30Hz (thirty measurements per second), but subsampled here to 0.1Hz (one measurement every 10 seconds), for practical reasons. If we would have plotted the data at 30hz, the plot would have included 108.000 data points. At 0.1Hz, this reduces to 3600 points. 

```{r genea-one-hour, fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = "One hour of raw data collected with a wrist-worn GENEActive  accelerometer, sub-sampled to 10-second epochs (0.1 Hz)", echo = FALSE}
# Plot one hour of accelerometer data.
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(emaph)

d <-  subset(genea,
              timestamp > "2018-06-01 13:00" &
              timestamp < "2018-06-01 14:00" &
              id == 1)

# resample to 30 seconds
d$timestamp <- lubridate::round_date(d$timestamp, "10 seconds")
d <- d %>% group_by(timestamp) %>% summarise_all(.funs = mean)

d <- gather(d,
             key = "sensor", value = "value",
             x, y, z)
ggplot(d, aes(timestamp, value)) +
  geom_line() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sensor) , scales = "free_y") + 
  ylab("acceleration") + 
  theme_classic(14)
```

Properties of the signals that are of interest are highly dependent on the focus of the study. Highly detailed analysis of local peaks in the signal might be needed, for instance to reveal an association between activity and reported events. But analyses can also be more global, for instance when accelerometer data are used to demonstrate circadian rhythms in activity.

### Data cleaning

Raw accelerometer data need to be cleaned before analyses can be run. Typical data import work-flows include re-calibration (to reduce systematic measurement error), the detection of non-wear periods (to ensure that non-informative data are removed), and subsampling (to reduce analysis processing time) and filtering/aggregation (to smoothen the signal and reduce the impact of outliers, measurement error and occasional missing values). 

### Feature extraction

Several approaches exist to combine the x, y, z measurements are combined into a single meaningful metric. Two popular metrics are the Signal Vector Magnitude (SVM) and the Euclidian Norm Minus One (ENMO). Validation studies suggest that ENMO should be the preferred metric [@VanHeest2014, @VanHeest2015], although results also suggest that alternative metrics should also be considered when sedentary and light activities are of interest [@Bai2016]. 

SVM and ENMO are closely related. SVM is the magnitude of the raw tri-axials signals (the Euclidian distance):

\begin{equation} \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \end{equation}

ENMO is the corrected SVM: the vector magnitude remaining after removing one Earth standard
gravitational unit (1g =  9.81 m/s^2).

\begin{equation} SVM - 1 \end{equation}

The metrics can, in principle, be calculated for each x,y,z-data point. Typically, however, the metrics are calculated for time-windows (called 'epochs'), in which case the mean is used to characterize the activity in the epoch.

Figure \@ref{fig:genea-one-day} shows the development of ENMO over one day, as sampled by GENEActive accelerometers that were worn by a young adult (top) and a middle-aged person (bottom). This figure is much easier to interpret than the plot of the raw x-y-z values in Figure \@ref{fig:genea-one-hour}. Activity levels over the day follow a similar pattern, but the activity levels in the two plots are strikingly different. Age appears to matter here: acitivity levels of the middle-aged person are consistently lower than those of the young adult.   

```{r genea-one-day, out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = "One day of data of the two persons in the GENEA data set of package 'emaph', summarised with ENMO, in 10-second epochs", echo = FALSE}
# Plot signal vector magnitude.
library(emaph)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

d <-  subset(genea,
              timestamp > "2018-06-02 00:00" &
              timestamp < "2018-06-02 23:59")
d$time <- round_date(d$timestamp, "10 seconds")

d <- d %>% 
  mutate(svm = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - 1) %>%
  mutate(svm = ifelse(svm < 0, 0, svm)) %>%
  group_by(id, time) %>% 
  summarise(svm = mean(svm))

ggplot(d, aes(time, svm)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("ENMO") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.1, color = "red") + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(id)) + 
  theme_classic(14)
```

### Geodata activity measures

Raw GPS data reflect series of locations rather than activity per se. However, measures of activity can be extracted from the raw series. Table \@ref(tab:GPSfeatures) shows various derived measures that were used in a small (n = 28) study of activity and depression, conducted by researchers of Northwestern University [@Saeb2015]. Circadian movement, normalized entropy, and location variance were found to be correlated to PHQ-9 scores (-.63 < r < -.58).
