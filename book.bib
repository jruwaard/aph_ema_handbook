  abstract        = {In the past two decades, the study of mood disorder patients using experience sampling methods (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has yielded important findings. In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the dynamics of their everyday mood have been associated with various aspects of their lives. To some degree similar studies have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In this paper we present the results of a systematic review of all ESM/EMA studies in MDD and BD to date. We focus not only on the correlates of patients' everyday mood but also on the impact on treatment, residual symptoms in remitted patients, on findings in pediatric populations, on MDD/BD specificity, and on links with neuroscience. After reviewing these six topics, we highlight the benefits of ESM/EMA for researchers, clinicians, and patients, and offer suggestions for future studies.},

After a brief historical review of self-report techniques, we discuss the latest perspective that links ambulatory self-reports to a qualitatively different conscious self-the "experiencing self"--which is functionally and neuroanatomically different from the "remembering" and "believing" selves measured through retrospective and trait questionnaires. The experiencing self functions to navigate current environments and is relatively more tied to the salience network and corporeal information from the body that regulates autonomic processes. As evidence, we review research showing that experiences measured through ambulatory assessment have stronger associations with cardiovascular reactivity, cortisol response, immune system function, and threat/reward biomarkers compared with memories or beliefs. By contrast, memories and beliefs play important roles in decision making and long-term planning, but they are less tied to bodily processes and more tied to default/long-term memory networks, which minimizes their sensitivity for certain research questions. We conclude with specific recommendations for using self-report questionnaires in psychosomatic medicine and suggest that intensive ambulatory assessment of experiences may provide greater sensitivity for connecting psychological with biologic processes.},

abstract = {Generic early-warning signals such as increased autocorrelation and variance have been demonstrated in time-series of systems with alternative stable states approaching a critical transition. However, lag times for the detection of such leading indicators are typically long. Here, we show that increased spatial correlation may serve as a more powerful early-warning signal in systems consisting of many coupled units. We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.},

  abstract = {Pick-A-Mood is a cartoon-based pictorial instrument for reporting and expressing moods. It measures eight distinct mood states in a quick and intuitive way, and can be used both for qualitative and quantitative research. Pick-A-Mood consists of three cartoon characters: a male, female and a robot character (Figure 1). Each character includes nine expressions that represent eight distinct mood states (and one neutral character). The sets are interchangeable; choice of character can be based on respondent demographics or on other pragmatic considerations. This manual provides a step-by-step guide for using Pick-A-Mood. Pick-A-Mood consists of three characters, each expressing eight different mood states (and a neutral expression), representing four basic mood categories: Excited-Lively and Cheerful-Happy (for energized-pleasant), Tense-Nervous and Irritated-Annoyed (for energized-unpleasant), Calm-Serene and Relaxed-Carefree (for calm-pleasant), and Bored-Weary and Gloomy-Sad (for calm-unpleasant), see Figure 2. The use of cartoon characters enables people to visually express or report their mood in an intuitive and easy-to-use way. Pick-A-Mood requires little time and effort of the respondents, making it suitable for design research applications, in which people often have little time or motivation to report their moods.},

In the context of mood disorders and mood dysregulation, we demonstrate that EMA can address specific research questions better than laboratory or questionnaire studies. However, before clinicians and researchers can fully realize these benefits, sets of standardized e-diary questionnaires and time sampling protocols must be developed that are reliable, valid, and sensitive to change.},

AA is the assessment of individuals in their daily lives, combining the twin benefits of increased ecological validity and minimized retrospective biases. These benefits make AA particularly well-suited to the assessment of dynamic processes, and recent advancements in technology are providing exciting new opportunities to understand these processes in new ways. In the current article, we briefly detail the capabilities currently offered by smartphones and mobile physiological devices, as well as some of the practical and ethical challenges of incorporating these new technologies into AA research. We then provide several examples of recent innovative applications of AA methodology in clinical research, assessment, and intervention and provide a case example of AA data generated from a study utilizing multiple mobile devices. In this way, we aim to provide a sense of direction for researchers planning AA studies of their own. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In the present article, we introduce the continuous unified electronic (CUE) diary method, a longitudinal, event-based, electronic parent report method that allows real-time recording of infant and child behavior in natural contexts. Thirty-nine expectant mothers were trained to identify and record target behaviors into programmed handheld computers. From birth to 18 months, maternal reporters recorded the initial, second, and third occurrences of seven target motor behaviors: palmar grasp, rolls from side to back, reaching when sitting, pincer grip, crawling, walking, and climbing stairs. Compliance was assessed as two valid entries per behavior: 97 {\%} of maternal reporters met compliance criteria. Reliability was assessed by comparing diary entries with researcher assessments for three of the motor behaviors: palmar grasp, pincer grip and walking. A total of 81 {\%} of maternal reporters met reliability criteria. For those three target behaviors, age of emergence was compared across data from the CUE diary method and researcher assessments. The CUE diary method was found to detect behaviors earlier and with greater sensitivity to individual differences. The CUE diary method is shown to be a reliable methodological tool for studying processes of change in human development.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A dichotomous ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnosis of depression does not fully capture its natural phenotype: a dimensional continuum of environmentally reactive fluctuations in mood. Therefore, ICD and DSM labels of depression, although useful from a service perspective, fail to help patients directly. This paper will show, using the author's experiences as an example, that patients with mood disorders can "diagnose" the natural phenotype, in the sense that systematic recording of painful fluctuations in environmentally reactive moods by the patient him- or herself may: (i) not only provide an accurate assessment of depression, but (ii) result in a process of conscious awareness of aberrant responses to the environment - a first step on the way to recovery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: The author developed a rudimentary but useable method to diagnose his dynamic mood fluctuations over the years. The continuous assessment method allowed him to systematically score his mood and activities every day, enabling him to study and analyse in detail the course and context of mood symptoms over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With time, this initial strategy evolved into a new, more informed, more empowered diagnosis of his problems and ultimately contributed to a more resilient mind set with regard to mood changes and ways of active rather than avoidant coping with them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many people with mood problems receive a DSM label but are not taught to engage in diagnosing what depression is: a dynamic pattern of environmentally reactive mood responses. Continuous diagnostic self-assessment strategies may help patients to learn, adjust and cope with their emotional vulnerabilities expressed as dimensional and reactive variation in mood. Patients can be empowered to diagnose experiences as a means to understand the sources and consequences of continuous mood variation over time.},

@article{HaedtMatt2011,
abstract = {The affect regulation model of binge eating, which posits that patients binge eat to reduce negative affect (NA), has received support from cross-sectional and laboratory-based studies. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves momentary ratings and repeated assessments over time and is ideally suited to identify temporal antecedents and consequences of binge eating. This meta-analytic review includes EMA studies of affect and binge eating. Electronic database and manual searches produced 36 EMA studies with N = 968 participants (89{\%} Caucasian women). Meta-analyses examined changes in affect before and after binge eating using within-subjects standardized mean gain effect sizes (ESs). Results supported greater NA preceding binge eating relative to average affect (ES = 0.63) and affect before regular eating (ES = 0.68). However, NA increased further following binge episodes (ES = 0.50). Preliminary findings suggested that NA decreased following purging in bulimia nervosa (ES = -0.46). Moderators included diagnosis (with significantly greater elevations of NA prior to bingeing in binge eating disorder compared to bulimia nervosa) and binge definition (with significantly smaller elevations of NA before binge vs. regular eating episodes for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition compared to lay definitions of binge eating). Overall, results fail to support the affect regulation model of binge eating and challenge reductions in NA as a maintenance factor for binge eating. However, limitations of this literature include unidimensional analyses of NA and inadequate examination of affect during binge eating, as binge eating may regulate only specific facets of affect or may reduce NA only during the episode.},

@article{Oorschot2012,
abstract = {Background: Hallucinations are a core feature of psychosis, often causing considerable distress. Reported prevalence ranges from 70{\%} for auditory hallucinations (AHs) to 30{\%} for visual hallucinations (VHs) and 4{\%} for hallucinations in the tactile domain. AHs have been studied extensively but studies on VHs are scarce. The current study investigated the phenomenology of VHs and AHs in the realm of daily life, by analyzing their prevalence, course and co-occurrence over a 6-day period and their temporal relation to emotions and delusions. Methods: The ESM, a structured diary technique, was used to investigate hallucinatory experiences in the context of daily life in a pooled data-set of 184 participants (71{\%} males) with psychosis spectrum disorders, which were recruited from mental health facilities in the south of the Netherlands and Belgium. All self-assessments were rated on 7-point Likert scales. VHs were defined using participants' scores on the item "I see phenomena". AHs were measured using the item "I hear voices". Results: Overall, 73 participants (40{\%}) reported hallucinations. Ten participants reported VHs only, 38 reported both VHs and AHs, and 25 participants reported AHs only. AHs co-occurred with VHs in 40{\%} of the hallucinatory moments. Patients with both VHs and AHs reported higher levels of negative affect, lower levels of positive affect and higher delusional intensity than non-hallucinating patients. Increased delusional intensity preceded the onset of hallucinatory episodes, whereas increases in positive or negative affect did not. Discussion: These results show that VHs are common in patients with psychosis spectrum disorders and often co-occur with AHs in time. Furthermore delusional ideation may precede hallucinatory episodes in the realm of daily life, rather than result from a hallucination and affective dysregulation might not play a primary role in hallucination onset. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

@article{Shiffman2009,
abstract = {Abstract Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is particularly suitable for studying substance use, because use is episodic and thought to be related to mood and context. This paper reviews EMA methods in substance use research, focusing on tobacco and alcohol use and relapse, where EMA has most been applied. Common EMA designs combine event-based reports of substance use with time-based assessments. Approaches to data organization and analysis have been very diverse, particularly regarding their treatment of time. Compliance with signaled assessments is often high. Compliance with recording of substance use appears good, but is harder to validate. Treatment applications of EMA are emerging. EMA captures substance use patterns not measured by questionnaires or retrospective data, and hold promise for substance use research.},

New techniques for assessing immediate experiences in respondents' natural environments (e.g., Ecological Momentary Assessment [1], Experience Sampling [2]) are being used by many researchers to reduce reporting bias. This article discusses seven aspects of momentary research that are often overlooked or minimized in the presentation of mo -mentary research reports, yet that are critical to the success of the research: (a) the rationale for the momentary sampling design, (b) the details of momentary sampling procedures, (c) the data acquisition interface, (d) rates of compliance with the sampling plan, (e) the procedures used to train and monitor participants, (f) data management procedures, and (g) the data analytic approach. Attention to these areas in both the design and reporting of momentary research studies will not only improve momentary research protocols but also allow for the successful replication of research findings by other investigators.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) is ideally suited to test the predictions, and inform the development of contemporary cognitive models of depression. Yet there has been no systematic examination of ESM in depression research. METHOD A search of databases (PsychARTICLES, PsycINFO, AMED, Ovid Medline and CINAHL) was conducted to identify studies published within the last 25 years investigating major depressive disorder (MDD) using ESM. RESULTS Altogether, 19 studies using ESM, or comparable methodologies, with clinically depressed individuals were identified and critically reviewed. The identified studies examined six aspects of MDD: methodological issues; positive and negative affect; cortisol secretion; antidepressant treatment; work performance; genetic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Despite some methodological limitations of existing studies, ESM has made a significant contribution to our current understanding of depression by consolidating existing theories, uncovering new and clinically relevant findings and identifying questions for future research. This review concludes by introducing the possibility of using ESM as an intervention tool in clinical practice and proposing that ESM could be useful for furthering knowledge of the causes of MDD.},

  abstract = {About 17{\%} of humanity goes through an episode of major depression at some point in their lifetime. Despite the enormous societal costs of this incapacitating disorder, it is largely unknown how the likelihood of falling into a depressive episode can be assessed. Here, we show for a large group of healthy individuals and patients that the probability of an upcoming shift between a depressed and a normal state is related to elevated temporal autocorrelation, variance, and correlation between emotions in fluctuations of autorecorded emotions. These are indicators of the general phenomenon of critical slowing down, which is expected to occur when a system approaches a tipping point. Our results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression.},

In addition, we evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using EMA techniques with this population and suggest additional areas that might be fruitful to investigate, with a focus on the extension of EMA techniques into treatment research. Overall, data suggest that using EMA techniques in mood disorders research is feasible, generally acceptable, and highly promising.

Momentary assessment technology as a tool to help patients with depression help themselves. Objective: Given high relapse rates and residual symptoms in depression, new strategies to increase treatment effectiveness are required. A promising avenue is to investigate how electronic momentary assessment technology may contribute to clinical assessment and interventions in depression. Method: A literature search was conducted focusing on the potential contribution of momentary assessments to clinical applications in depression. Results: Momentary assessments are able to reveal subtle, small but repetitive and relevant patterns of emotional expression that predict future course of depression. A momentary assessment tool may expose manageable pieces of daily life behaviour contributing to the depressive experience that patients can influence. The use of this explicit knowledge of daily life experience is understudied with regard to its contribution to diagnostic assessment, monitoring of treatment effects and feedback interventions in depressed patients. The clinical application of momentary assessments may stimulate a shift from passive consumption of treatment to an active role for patients in their recovery and increased patient ownership. Conclusion: The precise, prospective and fine-grained information that momentary assessment technology provides may contribute to clinical practice in various ways. Future studies should examine the clinical impact of its use and the feasibility of its implementation in mental health care.},

The experiment included a double-blind phase in which the dosage of anti-depressant medication was gradually reduced. The entire study looked at momentary affective states in daily life before, during, and after the double-blind phase. The items, which were asked ten times a day, cover topics like mood, physical condition and social contacts. Also, depressive symptoms were measured on a weekly basis using the Symptom Check-list Revised (SCL-90-R). The data are suitable for various time-series analyses and studies in complex dynamical systems.
