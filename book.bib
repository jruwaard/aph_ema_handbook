  abstract        = {In the past two decades, the study of mood disorder patients using experience sampling methods (ESM) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has yielded important findings. In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the dynamics of their everyday mood have been associated with various aspects of their lives. To some degree similar studies have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In this paper we present the results of a systematic review of all ESM/EMA studies in MDD and BD to date. We focus not only on the correlates of patients' everyday mood but also on the impact on treatment, residual symptoms in remitted patients, on findings in pediatric populations, on MDD/BD specificity, and on links with neuroscience. After reviewing these six topics, we highlight the benefits of ESM/EMA for researchers, clinicians, and patients, and offer suggestions for future studies.},

After a brief historical review of self-report techniques, we discuss the latest perspective that links ambulatory self-reports to a qualitatively different conscious self-the "experiencing self"--which is functionally and neuroanatomically different from the "remembering" and "believing" selves measured through retrospective and trait questionnaires. The experiencing self functions to navigate current environments and is relatively more tied to the salience network and corporeal information from the body that regulates autonomic processes. As evidence, we review research showing that experiences measured through ambulatory assessment have stronger associations with cardiovascular reactivity, cortisol response, immune system function, and threat/reward biomarkers compared with memories or beliefs. By contrast, memories and beliefs play important roles in decision making and long-term planning, but they are less tied to bodily processes and more tied to default/long-term memory networks, which minimizes their sensitivity for certain research questions. We conclude with specific recommendations for using self-report questionnaires in psychosomatic medicine and suggest that intensive ambulatory assessment of experiences may provide greater sensitivity for connecting psychological with biologic processes.},

Fortunately, as demonstrated by the broad scope of this handbook, there is an increasing number of methodologies for studying the full range of experiences, behavior, and physiology as people go about their daily lives. Our goal in this chapter is to provide a starting point for researchers interesting in using these methods. Our aim is to provide practical guidance and basic considerations in how to design and conduct a study of individuals over time in their naturalistic environments. We explain how basic design considerations depend on a number of factorsâ€”the type of research question, the characteristics of the sample of interest, the nature of the phenomena under investigation, and the resources available to conduct the research. We address each consideration in turn and integrate our practical discussions with examples that draw on different types of research questions. In this way, our chapter lays a foundation for the more advanced chapters that follow in this section of the Handbook. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Generic early-warning signals such as increased autocorrelation and variance have been demonstrated in time-series of systems with alternative stable states approaching a critical transition. However, lag times for the detection of such leading indicators are typically long. Here, we show that increased spatial correlation may serve as a more powerful early-warning signal in systems consisting of many coupled units. We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.},

  abstract = {Pick-A-Mood is a cartoon-based pictorial instrument for reporting and expressing moods. It measures eight distinct mood states in a quick and intuitive way, and can be used both for qualitative and quantitative research. Pick-A-Mood consists of three cartoon characters: a male, female and a robot character (Figure 1). Each character includes nine expressions that represent eight distinct mood states (and one neutral character). The sets are interchangeable; choice of character can be based on respondent demographics or on other pragmatic considerations. This manual provides a step-by-step guide for using Pick-A-Mood. Pick-A-Mood consists of three characters, each expressing eight different mood states (and a neutral expression), representing four basic mood categories: Excited-Lively and Cheerful-Happy (for energized-pleasant), Tense-Nervous and Irritated-Annoyed (for energized-unpleasant), Calm-Serene and Relaxed-Carefree (for calm-pleasant), and Bored-Weary and Gloomy-Sad (for calm-unpleasant), see Figure 2. The use of cartoon characters enables people to visually express or report their mood in an intuitive and easy-to-use way. Pick-A-Mood requires little time and effort of the respondents, making it suitable for design research applications, in which people often have little time or motivation to report their moods.},

In the context of mood disorders and mood dysregulation, we demonstrate that EMA can address specific research questions better than laboratory or questionnaire studies.

These benefits make AA particularly well-suited to the assessment of dynamic processes, and recent advancements in technology are providing exciting new opportunities to understand these processes in new ways. In the current article, we briefly detail the capabilities currently offered by smartphones and mobile physiological devices, as well as some of the practical and ethical challenges of incorporating these new technologies into AA research. We then provide several examples of recent innovative applications of AA methodology in clinical research, assessment, and intervention and provide a case example of AA data generated from a study utilizing multiple mobile devices.

abstract = {In the present article, we introduce the continuous unified electronic (CUE) diary method, a longitudinal, event-based, electronic parent report method that allows real-time recording of infant and child behavior in natural contexts. Thirty-nine expectant mothers were trained to identify and record target behaviors into programmed handheld computers. From birth to 18 months, maternal reporters recorded the initial, second, and third occurrences of seven target motor behaviors: palmar grasp, rolls from side to back, reaching when sitting, pincer grip, crawling, walking, and climbing stairs. Compliance was assessed as two valid entries per behavior: 97 {\%} of maternal reporters met compliance criteria. Reliability was assessed by comparing diary entries with researcher assessments for three of the motor behaviors: palmar grasp, pincer grip and walking. A total of 81 {\%} of maternal reporters met reliability criteria. For those three target behaviors, age of emergence was compared across data from the CUE diary method and researcher assessments. The CUE diary method was found to detect behaviors earlier and with greater sensitivity to individual differences. The CUE diary method is shown to be a reliable methodological tool for studying processes of change in human development.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A dichotomous ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnosis of depression does not fully capture its natural phenotype: a dimensional continuum of environmentally reactive fluctuations in mood. Therefore, ICD and DSM labels of depression, although useful from a service perspective, fail to help patients directly. This paper will show, using the author's experiences as an example, that patients with mood disorders can "diagnose" the natural phenotype, in the sense that systematic recording of painful fluctuations in environmentally reactive moods by the patient him- or herself may: (i) not only provide an accurate assessment of depression, but (ii) result in a process of conscious awareness of aberrant responses to the environment - a first step on the way to recovery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: The author developed a rudimentary but useable method to diagnose his dynamic mood fluctuations over the years. The continuous assessment method allowed him to systematically score his mood and activities every day, enabling him to study and analyse in detail the course and context of mood symptoms over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With time, this initial strategy evolved into a new, more informed, more empowered diagnosis of his problems and ultimately contributed to a more resilient mind set with regard to mood changes and ways of active rather than avoidant coping with them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many people with mood problems receive a DSM label but are not taught to engage in diagnosing what depression is: a dynamic pattern of environmentally reactive mood responses. Continuous diagnostic self-assessment strategies may help patients to learn, adjust and cope with their emotional vulnerabilities expressed as dimensional and reactive variation in mood. Patients can be empowered to diagnose experiences as a means to understand the sources and consequences of continuous mood variation over time.},

@article{HaedtMatt2011,
abstract = {The affect regulation model of binge eating, which posits that patients binge eat to reduce negative affect (NA), has received support from cross-sectional and laboratory-based studies. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves momentary ratings and repeated assessments over time and is ideally suited to identify temporal antecedents and consequences of binge eating. This meta-analytic review includes EMA studies of affect and binge eating. Electronic database and manual searches produced 36 EMA studies with N = 968 participants (89{\%} Caucasian women). Meta-analyses examined changes in affect before and after binge eating using within-subjects standardized mean gain effect sizes (ESs). Results supported greater NA preceding binge eating relative to average affect (ES = 0.63) and affect before regular eating (ES = 0.68). However, NA increased further following binge episodes (ES = 0.50). Preliminary findings suggested that NA decreased following purging in bulimia nervosa (ES = -0.46). Moderators included diagnosis (with significantly greater elevations of NA prior to bingeing in binge eating disorder compared to bulimia nervosa) and binge definition (with significantly smaller elevations of NA before binge vs. regular eating episodes for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition compared to lay definitions of binge eating). Overall, results fail to support the affect regulation model of binge eating and challenge reductions in NA as a maintenance factor for binge eating. However, limitations of this literature include unidimensional analyses of NA and inadequate examination of affect during binge eating, as binge eating may regulate only specific facets of affect or may reduce NA only during the episode.},

abstract = {Laboratory-based experimental methods historically have been the strength and pride of psychology and related disciplines. Yet a comprehensive science of behavior also requires the study of humans in real life. Bringing together leading investigators, this book reviews the breadth of current approaches for studying how people think, feel, and behave in everyday environments. The Handbook is organized in four parts. Part I covers the theoretical and methodological foundations of conducting daily life research. Part II provides guidance for designing a high-quality study and selecting and implementing appropriate methods. The chapters describe experience sampling methods, diary methods, ambulatory physiological measures, and other toolsâ€”including recording technologies and computerized approachesâ€”that allow repeated, real-time measurement in natural settings. Part III focuses on techniques for analyzing intensive data from daily life, featuring practical discussions of power analysis, psychometrics, data cleaning, multilevel modeling, time series analysis, and other topics. Part IV reviews how methods for studying daily life have been employed in different subfields and research areas, such as the study of emotion, close relationships, personality, health, development, psychopathology, and mental health treatment. Specific advantages and challenges inherent to using the methods in each area are discussed. Timely and authoritative, this handbook meets a key need for research psychologists and for graduate students in social/personality, health, developmental, industrial/organizational, and clinical psychology.

abstract = {Current methods of assessment in clinical psychopharmacology have several serious disadvantages, particularly for the study of social functioning. We aimed to review the strengths and weaknesses of current methods used in clinical psychopharmacology and to compare them with a group of methods, developed by personality/social psychologists, termed ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which permit the research participant to report on symptoms, affect and behaviour close in time to experience and which sample many events or time periods. EMA has a number of advantages over more traditional methods for the assessment of patients in clinical psychopharmacological studies. It can both complement and, in part, replace existing methods. EMA methods will permit more sensitive assessments and will enable more wide-ranging and detailed measurements of mood and behaviour. These types of methods should be adopted more widely by clinical psychopharmacology researchers.},

@article{Oorschot2012,
abstract = {Background: Hallucinations are a core feature of psychosis, often causing considerable distress. Reported prevalence ranges from 70{\%} for auditory hallucinations (AHs) to 30{\%} for visual hallucinations (VHs) and 4{\%} for hallucinations in the tactile domain. AHs have been studied extensively but studies on VHs are scarce. The current study investigated the phenomenology of VHs and AHs in the realm of daily life, by analyzing their prevalence, course and co-occurrence over a 6-day period and their temporal relation to emotions and delusions. Methods: The ESM, a structured diary technique, was used to investigate hallucinatory experiences in the context of daily life in a pooled data-set of 184 participants (71{\%} males) with psychosis spectrum disorders, which were recruited from mental health facilities in the south of the Netherlands and Belgium. All self-assessments were rated on 7-point Likert scales. VHs were defined using participants' scores on the item "I see phenomena". AHs were measured using the item "I hear voices". Results: Overall, 73 participants (40{\%}) reported hallucinations. Ten participants reported VHs only, 38 reported both VHs and AHs, and 25 participants reported AHs only. AHs co-occurred with VHs in 40{\%} of the hallucinatory moments. Patients with both VHs and AHs reported higher levels of negative affect, lower levels of positive affect and higher delusional intensity than non-hallucinating patients. Increased delusional intensity preceded the onset of hallucinatory episodes, whereas increases in positive or negative affect did not. Discussion: These results show that VHs are common in patients with psychosis spectrum disorders and often co-occur with AHs in time. Furthermore delusional ideation may precede hallucinatory episodes in the realm of daily life, rather than result from a hallucination and affective dysregulation might not play a primary role in hallucination onset. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper reviews EMA methods in substance use research, focusing on tobacco and alcohol use and relapse, where EMA has most been applied. Common EMA designs combine event-based reports of substance use with time-based assessments. Approaches to data organization and analysis have been very diverse, particularly regarding their treatment of time. Compliance with signaled assessments is often high. Compliance with recording of substance use appears good, but is harder to validate. Treatment applications of EMA are emerging. EMA captures substance use patterns not measured by questionnaires or retrospective data, and hold promise for substance use research.},

Yet there has been no systematic examination of ESM in depression research. METHOD A search of databases (PsychARTICLES, PsycINFO, AMED, Ovid Medline and CINAHL) was conducted to identify studies published within the last 25 years investigating major depressive disorder (MDD) using ESM. RESULTS Altogether, 19 studies using ESM, or comparable methodologies, with clinically depressed individuals were identified and critically reviewed. The identified studies examined six aspects of MDD: methodological issues; positive and negative affect; cortisol secretion; antidepressant treatment; work performance; genetic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Despite some methodological limitations of existing studies, ESM has made a significant contribution to our current understanding of depression by consolidating existing theories, uncovering new and clinically relevant findings and identifying questions for future research. This review concludes by introducing the possibility of using ESM as an intervention tool in clinical practice and proposing that ESM could be useful for furthering knowledge of the causes of MDD.},

Despite the enormous societal costs of this incapacitating disorder, it is largely unknown how the likelihood of falling into a depressive episode can be assessed. Here, we show for a large group of healthy individuals and patients that the probability of an upcoming shift between a depressed and a normal state is related to elevated temporal autocorrelation, variance, and correlation between emotions in fluctuations of autorecorded emotions. These are indicators of the general phenomenon of critical slowing down, which is expected to occur when a system approaches a tipping point. Our results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression.},

Momentary assessment technology as a tool to help patients with depression help themselves. Objective: Given high relapse rates and residual symptoms in depression, new strategies to increase treatment effectiveness are required. A promising avenue is to investigate how electronic momentary assessment technology may contribute to clinical assessment and interventions in depression. Method: A literature search was conducted focusing on the potential contribution of momentary assessments to clinical applications in depression. Results: Momentary assessments are able to reveal subtle, small but repetitive and relevant patterns of emotional expression that predict future course of depression. A momentary assessment tool may expose manageable pieces of daily life behaviour contributing to the depressive experience that patients can influence. The use of this explicit knowledge of daily life experience is understudied with regard to its contribution to diagnostic assessment, monitoring of treatment effects and feedback interventions in depressed patients. The clinical application of momentary assessments may stimulate a shift from passive consumption of treatment to an active role for patients in their recovery and increased patient ownership. Conclusion: The precise, prospective and fine-grained information that momentary assessment technology provides may contribute to clinical practice in various ways. Future studies should examine the clinical impact of its use and the feasibility of its implementation in mental health care.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW In this review, we discuss feasibility, content, and where possible efficacy of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) in psychiatry. EMIs adopt mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants or smartphones, for the delivery of treatments in the daily life of patients. We will discuss EMIs in the field of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression disorder, as well as one generic, transdiagnostic EMI. RECENT FINDINGS The few studies that are available all underscore feasibility and acceptability of mobile health approaches in patients with severe mental illness. In terms of content, there is a huge variety in approaches ranging from a mixture of face-to-face contacts augmented with EMI components to a fully automated EMI. With regard to efficacy, only two randomized clinical trials have been conducted, supporting the efficacy of EMIs in mental health. Evidence seems to point toward greater efficacy when EMI is integrated with real-life assessment using experience sampling methodology, preferentially tailoring the intervention toward the specific needs of the individual as well as toward those moments when intervention is needed. SUMMARY The review demonstrates that mobile health may be an important asset to the mental health field but underscores that it still is in its very early ages. In the discussion, we point toward ways of improving EMIs for severe mental illness, changing our perspective from testing feasibility to testing efficacy and ultimately implementing EMIs in routine mental health services.},

Pick-A-Mood consists of three characters that each express eight mood states, representing four main categories: excited and cheerful (for energised-pleasant), irritated and tense (for energised-unpleasant), relaxed and calm (for calm-pleasant), and bored and sad (for calm-unpleasant). Using Pick-A-Mood requires little effort on the part of respondents, making it suitable for design research applications in which people often have little time or motivation to report their moods. Contrary to what is often assumed, mood and emotion are distinct phenomena with different measurable manifestations. These differences are discussed, and a review of existing methods is provided, indicating to what extent current methods that measure emotion are suitable for measuring mood. The development and validation of Pick-A-Mood is reported, and application examples and research opportunities are discussed.

abstract = {(from the chapter) Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a method for collecting data in real time and in real-world settings. EMA is particularly well suited for studying substance use, because use patterns are highly complex and related to contextual factors like mood, setting, and cues. This chapter addresses the application of EMA to substance use research, outlining principles of EMA design and analysis, and illustrating them with examples from the literature. The chapter considers the way technological innovations are facilitating the rapid evolution of EMA systems, and provides recommendations on current best practices. It reviews data on methodological issues such as compliance and reactivity, and looks forward to the way emerging technologies will enable increasingly unobtrusive assessment of both individual- and systems-level processes over time and space. EMA methods reveal substance use patterns not captured by questionnaires or retrospective data, and hold great promise for substance use research and treatment.

abstract = {Background: Craving is viewed as a major determinant of relapse in persons with substance addiction, but this association remains poorly understood due to its time-limited nature and the biases associated with retrospective reporting. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers new opportunities to examine both craving and substance use with strong ecological validity by collecting real-time data in daily life. This review examined all published studies using EMA to: (1) assess the link between craving and substance use; and (2) identify relevant moderators of craving among substance users. Methods: We searched PubMed and PsycInfo databases up to October 31, 2013. Results: Ninety-one studies were selected, involving mostly tobacco smokers (73{\%}). A majority of studies (92{\%}) reported a positive relationship between craving and substance use, concurrently and prospectively, and among users with different levels of use for both legal and illegal substances. Results suggest that craving is a stronger predictor of relapse episodes when assessed in close temporal proximity to substance use. EMA data also confirmed the influence of diverse within-person and between-person sources of variation in daily life craving reports. Conclusions: This review provides strong support for the link between craving and substance use, and underscores the importance of the timing of assessments.},

Similarly, our understanding of determinants of both successful and unsuccessful weight loss surgery is also quite limited. While a number of research methodologies have been applied to these areas, one methodology that has recently seen a rise in popularity is the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA allows one to study a variety of variables of interest in the natural environment. The study of eating disorders, obesity, and bariatric surgery has all been conducted using EMA recently. The current study is a review of these areas and summarizes the recent literature (past 3Â years) in eating disorders, obesity, and bariatric surgery using EMA methodology.},

abstract = {As mobile data capture tools for patient-reported outcomes proliferate in clinical research, a key dimension of measure performance is sensitivity to change. This study compared performance of patient-reported measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety symptoms using traditional paper-and-pencil forms versus real-time, ambulatory measurement of symptoms via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Sixty-seven emotionally distressed older adults completed paper-and-pencil measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety along with two weeks of identical items reported during ambulatory monitoring via EMA before and after participation in a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a health education intervention. We calculated effect sizes for these measures across both measurement approaches and estimated the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) in both measurement conditions. Study outcomes greatly differed depending on which measurement method was used. When EMA was used to measure clinical symptoms, older adults who participated in the MBSR intervention had significantly higher mindfulness and significantly lower depression and anxiety than participants in the health education intervention at post-treatment. However, these significant changes in symptoms were not found when outcomes were measured with paper-and-pencil measures. The NNT for mindfulness and depression measures administered through EMA were approximately 25-50{\%} lower than NNTs derived from paper-and-pencil administration. Sensitivity to change in anxiety was similar across administration modes. In conclusion, EMA measures of depression and mindfulness substantially outperformed paper-and-pencil measures with the same items. The additional resources associated with EMA in clinical trials would seem to be offset by its greater sensitivity to detect change in key outcome variables.},

It also determines whether ecological momentary assessment fulfills the criteria of validity, reliability, objectivity, norms, and standardization applied to the tools used for the evaluation of physical activity. METHODS The EBSCO-CINHAL, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SPORTDiscuss databases were reviewed in December 2012 for articles associated with EMA. RESULTS Of the 20 articles examined, half (10) used electronic methods for data collection, although various methods were used, ranging from pen and paper to smartphone applications. Ten studies used objective monitoring equipment. Nineteen studies were performed over 4 days. While the validity of the EMA method was discussed in 18 studies, only four found it to be objective. In all cases, the EMA procedures were precisely documented and confirmed to be feasible. CONCLUSIONS Ecological momentary assessment is a valid, reliable, and feasible approach to evaluate activity and sedentary behavior. Researchers should be aware that while ecological momentary assessment offers many benefits, it simultaneously imposes many limitations which should be considered when studying physical activity.},

In the field of depression, EMA reactivity has received little attention. We aim to investigate whether EMA of depressive symptoms induces assessment reactivity. Reactivity will be operationalised as an effect of EMA on depressive symptoms measured by a retrospective questionnaire, and, secondly, as a change in response rate and variance of the EMA ratings. This study is a 12-week randomised controlled trial comprising three groups: group 1 carries out EMA of mood and completes a retrospective questionnaire, group 2 carries out EMA of how energetic they feel and completes a retrospective questionnaire, group 3 is the control group, which completes only the retrospective questionnaire. The retrospective questionnaire (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale; CES-D) assesses depressive symptoms and is administered at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline and 12 weeks after baseline. We aim to recruit 160 participants who experience mild to moderate depressive symptoms, defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 5 to 15. This study is powered to detect a small between-groups effect, where no clinically relevant effect is defined as the effect size margin âˆ’0.25{\textless} d {\textless}0.25.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A dichotomous ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnosis of depression does not fully capture its natural phenotype: a dimensional continuum of environmentally reactive fluctuations in mood. Therefore, ICD and DSM labels of depression, although useful from a service perspective, fail to help patients directly. This paper will show, using the author's experiences as an example, that patients with mood disorders can "diagnose" the natural phenotype, in the sense that systematic recording of painful fluctuations in environmentally reactive moods by the patient him- or herself may: (i) not only provide an accurate assessment of depression, but (ii) result in a process of conscious awareness of aberrant responses to the environment - a first step on the way to recovery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: The author developed a rudimentary but useable method to diagnose his dynamic mood fluctuations over the years. The continuous assessment method allowed him to systematically score his mood and activities every day, enabling him to study and analyse in detail the course and context of mood symptoms over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With time, this initial strategy evolved into a new, more informed, more empowered diagnosis of his problems and ultimately contributed to a more resilient mind set with regard to mood changes and ways of active rather than avoidant coping with them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Many people with mood problems receive a DSM label but are not taught to engage in diagnosing what depression is: a dynamic pattern of environmentally reactive mood responses. Continuous diagnostic self-assessment strategies may help patients to learn, adjust and cope with their emotional vulnerabilities expressed as dimensional and reactive variation in mood. Patients can be empowered to diagnose experiences as a means to understand the sources and consequences of continuous mood variation over time.},

The aim of the current study was to examine whether a single-item mood scale can be used for mood monitoring. One hundred thirty remitted out-patients were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders (SCID-I), Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS), 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17), and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR). Of all patients, 13.8{\%} relapsed during follow-up assessments. Area under the curves (AUCs) for the VAMS, HAM-D17and IDS-SR were 0.94, 0.91, and, 0.86, respectively. The VAMS had the highest positive predictive value (PPV) without any false negatives at score 55 (PPV=0.53; NPV=1.0) and was the best predictor of current relapse status (variance explained for VAMS: 60{\%}; for HAM-D17:49{\%}; for IDS-SR: 34{\%}). Only the HAM-D17added significant variance to the model (7{\%}). Assessing sad mood with a single-item mood scale seems to be a straightforward and patient-friendly avenue for life-long mood monitoring. Using a diagnostic interview (e.g., the SCID) in case of a positive screen is warranted. Repeated assessment of the VAMS using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) might reduce false positives.},

Mood ratings reflect a hierarchical structure consisting of two broad dimensions-Positive Affect and Negative Affect-and multiple specific states. Brief scales have been developed that reliably assess Positive and Negative Affect across different populations and time frames, in both between- and within-subject data. We examine controversies related to (a) the content of these higher order scales and (b) the independence of Positive and Negative Affect. Regarding the latter, we show that Positive and Negative Affect scales remain largely independent across a wide range of conditions, even after controlling for random and systematic error. Finally, there remains little consensus regarding the lower order structure of affect.

abstract = {Objective: Novel study designs using within-subject methodology and frequent and prospective measurements are required to unravel direction of causality and dynamic processes of behavior over time. The current study examined the effects of physical activity on affective state. A primary and within-study replication sample was derived from twin pairs. Methods: Female twins (n = 504) participated in an experience sampling method study at baseline. Positive and negative affective changes were examined before and following daily life increases in physical activity. Neuroticism was measured at baseline and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at each of four follow-up assessments. Diagnoses, derived by Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Healthâ€“IV axis I disorders, (A. P. A., 1994) were obtained at baseline. Results: A significant increase in positive affect (PA) following the moment of increase in physical activity was replicated across both samples up to 180 min after physical activity. There was no effect of physical activity on negative affect (NA). Across the two samples, a history of fulfilling diagnostic criteria for depression at least once moderated the effect of physical activity on PA, in that the effect was lost more rapidly. Conclusions: The study supports a causal effect of physical activity on PA. However, people with past experience of clinical depression may benefit less from the PA-inducing effect of physical activity. These findings have implications for the use of physical exercise in clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved)},
