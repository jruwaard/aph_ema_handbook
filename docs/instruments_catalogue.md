## EMA Platforms & Apps

### Ilumivu
\index{Ilumivu}

Ilumivu (<https://ilumivu.com/>) is an American commercial company specialised
in mobile EMA application development. It offers a cross-platform (Android and
IOS) smartphone app (mEMA) that researchers can use to collect data from study
participants. 

Researchers can define the assessment plan of their study in an
online back-office. The Ilumivu EMA toolbox library includes a rather complete
set of survey elements, survey logic branching tools, and survey scheduling
options. Passive EMA options include GPS tagging (of survey responses),
Geo-fencing (triggering surveys at specific locations) and smartphone sensor
logging (light and noise level, screen brightness, screen locked/unlocked,
humidity, ambient temperature, barometric pressure, phone/SMS activity log, and
basic device information). With the online back-office, researchers can invite
participants, monitor study compliance and download data (in common data formats
such as CSV). 

A limited number of smart watch devices can optionally be linked to the Ilumivu app for further passive data collection. The company is open for custom development, when studies require features that are not included in the default app. 

Current (July 2018) subscription plans range
from 3.375 dollar (basic features) to 12.000 dollar (all features), per year.
Researchers, who are interested in purchasing a license of the service, are
advised to consult the 'Grant Writer's Guide' of Ilumivu (at
<https://ilumivu.com/pricing/writing-a-grant/>). Ilumivu's competitive advantage
is that it has multi-platform support. It is, however, not the cheapest EMA
product on the market. Being an American company, researchers should also
consider EU regulations relating to personal data privacy protection, since
regulations are stricter when personal data of EU citizens leave the EU.

### Moodbuster
\index{Moodbuster}

Moodbuster (<http://moodbuster.eu/>) is a web-based treatment platform with an
integrated EMA app. The platform was developed by an international non-profit
research consortium, including VU, VUmc and GGZ inGeest, in two major EU-funded
research projects: ICT4Depression [see ICT4Depression.eu; @warmerdam2012] and
E-COMPARED [see <http://e-compared.eu>; @Kleiboer2016; @VandeVen2017]. 

In the E-COMPARED trial, Moodbuster was used, in five EU-countries, to test blended
treatment of major depression. In this study, participants used the smartphone
app to rate mood and various other depression-related variables, in the context
of their treatment, over a period of up to 20 weeks. 

E-COMPARED EMA data were used in several predictive machine learning studies
[@mikus2018; @rocha2018]. In addition, the EMA app was used in a satellite
study designed to assess the effects of long-term EMA [@VanBallegooijen2016].
Moodbuster will also be used in the EU ImpleMentAll project
(<http://www.implementall.eu>) and in several other clinical trials that are in
preparation. Currently, EMA assessment protocols are hard-coded in the
Moodbuster app. New EMA assessments protocols can be implemented in
collaboration with the Moodbuster development team. An online back-office is in
development. Previous studies used an Android version of the EMA app.
Cross-platform versions of the app are in development.

More information on Moodbuster can be obtained from prof. dr. Heleen Riper
(<h.riper@vu.nl>).

### Movisens
\index{Movisens}

Movisens (<http://www.movisens.com>) is a German company that is specialized in
the development of hard- and software solutions for mobile sensing. The company
sells small wearable devices that contain several high-precision sensors,
including an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer and thermometer. In addition,
the company has developed an (Android) app, called MovisensXS, which can be used
for active EMA research. The app can optionally be configured for smartphone
logging (e.g., to log music that a study participant listens this). The wearable
sensor can also be linked to the app, so that EMA questionnaires can be
triggered based on targeted activity or energy expenditure patterns, such as
extended periods of sedentary behavior. 

Specialized software to import, pre-process and analyze raw sensor data is
available for download. Like Ilumivu, researchers can define EMA sample
schedules for their study in a web-based back-office
(<https://xs.movisens.com>), using an online graphical editor. Once defined,
participants can be invited to the study , through the back-office, to download
the freely available Movisens App from Google Play store. The back-office also
allows researchers to monitor study compliance and download data. 

MoviSensXS EMA license costs vary from 500 to 10.000 euro's per year, depending
on the required number of 'credits' which are linked to the number of EMA
responses. Prospect users can test platform, without functional restrictions,
with a free test account. An EMA test-study can thus be set up and started in
less than a day. A current (November 2018) limitation of Movisens is the lack of
an iOS version of the EMA app. Study participants who own an iPhone have to be
excluded from studies, or will have to be provided with an Android phone.

### PsyMate
\index{PsyMate}

The PsyMate app (<http://www.psymate.eu>) was developed by the Department of
Psychiatry and Psychology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands to assess
psychological problems in daily life. The app has been validated for use in
depression, bipolar disorder, and psychosis, with new scales currently being
developed for a range of diseases including Parkinson's disease, pain,
cardiology, hypertension, diabetes and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It was also
used in a EU-funded project to study gene-environment interaction in
schizophrenia (<http://www.eu-gei.eu/about-the-project/psymate>). 

The app is free to download for iOS and Android devices on Apple and Google play
stores. PsyMate is available in five languages (English, French, German, Dutch,
Spanish). More translations are in preparation.

Uses of the app include self-monitoring of mood states, delivering professional
support during treatment, or conducting EMA-research. The app can be customized
to address specific client needs or research projects, with expertise from the
Psymate development team, which includes an active working group that meets
regularly to discuss and advise new projects. Researchers have access to the raw
data without having to go through the Psymate development team. Communication
from the Psymate back office to researchers about updates and assistance with
technical problems could be a point for consideration for using this platform.

### RoQua
\index{RoQua}

RoQua (<http://www.roqua.nl/>) is a web-based Routine Outcome Monitoring system,
developed and maintained by a Dutch non-profit development and service
organization that is funded by several by northern GGZ organizations and the
Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Center Groningen. RoQUA has a
sophisticated and user-friendly online back-office portal, with which
researchers can define assessment protocols and invite study participants -
through e-mail or SMS - to complete questionnaires online (on desktop or mobile
devices). 

By inviting study participants several times a day to complete a
questionnaire via the standard web browser of their mobile phone, active EMA an
be implemented. This approach was taken in several large-scale studies,
including 'NESDA' [<http://nesda.nl>; see also Chapter \@ref(catalogue)) and
'HowNutsAreTheDutch' (<http://www.hoegekis.nl>; @VanDerKrieke2017;
@VanDerKrieke2016]. At present, RoQua does not support the collection of
passive EMA data. However, preliminary results have been reported with a system
called 'Physiqual' [@Blaauw2016], with which active EMA data, collected with RoQUA,
can be combined with wearable sensor data.

## Wearables

### GENEActive
\index{GENEActive}

GENEActive, sold by UK-based company Activinsights (<http://activinsights.com>),
is a waterproof wrist-worn device with a high-precision, configurable 3-axial
accelerometer (range: +/- 8g), an ambient light sensor, a (near-body)
temperature sensor, and an event logger (a button that users can press to mark a
targeted event). GENEActive was developed to accurately assess human activity in
scientific studies. The device has a storage capacity of 0.5GB of raw data.
At 10Hz, the device can log activity up to one month. July 2018, the price for
one unit was approximately 250 euro.

GENEActive is used in a growing number of clinical studies to measure activity
and sleep-wake cycles, in natural conditions, over longer periods of time.
Dedicated R-packages to pre-process and analyze the raw data exist (see Chapter
\@ref(rcat)). Matlab users should consider the open source 'Actant - Activity Analysis Toolbox' (https://github.com/maximosipov/actant), by Osipov & Te Lindert, which includes functionality for visualization and analysis of behavioral
and environmental timeseries, acquired using GENEActiv (and other)
accelerometers. No accompanying app exists with which study
participants can be provided feedback about their activity. This might
negatively affect wear-time and study compliance in research participants, who
are accustomed to consumer activity-sampling devices, such as Fitbit, where many
options for real-time feedback exist.

### VU-AMS
\index{VU-AMS}

The VU University Ambulatory Monitoring System (VU-AMS;
<http://www.vu-ams.nl/>), developed by the department of Biological Psychology
and the Technical Department (ITM) of the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement
Sciences, allows ambulatory recording of autonomic and cardiovascular activity.
VU-AMS measures heart rate, heart rate variability, Respiratory Sinus
Arrhythmia, Pre-Ejection Period, Left Ventricular Ejection Time, Respiration
Rate, Stroke Volume (SV) and Cardiac Output, Skin Conductance Level (SCL) and
Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) and Tri-Axial Accelerometry (of Body
Movement). For the processing of VU-AMS data, a dedicated software suite called
the 'Data Analysis and Management Software' (VU-DAMS) is available (for Windows
and Mac).
