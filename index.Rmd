# Preface {-}

Given known limitations of retrospective self-report questionnaires, such
as recall bias and poor generalisability of assessment results to real-life
situations, mental health researchers increasingly adopt alternative assessment
tools. One of the promising alternatives is Ecological Momentary Assessment
(EMA), in which emotions and behaviours are repeatedly sampled in everyday
life, through wearable electronic devices. By providing detailed data on within-
person processes, EMA may be the key in the development of personalised health
interventions.

EMA studies are challenging. Researchers, who are new to the field, face
a dazzling array of options related to the electronic wearables, outcomes
selection, study design considerations, ethical and regulatory constraints, data
management, statistical analysis, and study reporting. Although standards are
emerging, clear guidelines for EMA research do not - at present - exist.

This research manual provides a practical introduction to EMA-research. It was
written for the Amsterdam School of Public Health (APH), to aid beginning
researchers looking for practical advice in conducting EMA studies. It provides
an overview of EMA instruments, outcomes, methods and analytical techniques,
guidelines for EMA-studies, and a catalogue of EMA research in the APH
consortium.

The manual comprises six parts:

- Part I introduces EMA and R. Chapter 1 defines EMA, and discusses the
opportunities and challenges of EMA research. Chapter 2 introduces R, the
indespensable tool for EMA researcher.

- Part II focuses on EMA study design (chapter 3), EMA instruments (chapter 4)
and EMA data management (Chapter 5).

- Part III introduces four EMA data analysis techniques: Feature Extraction
(chapter 6), Mixed Modelling (chapter 7), Timeseries Analysis (chapter 8), and
Network Analysis (chapter 9).

- Part IV details the momentary assessment of three key mental health variables:
Mood (chapter 10), Activity (chapter 11), and Context (chapter 12).

- In part V, the application of the preceding material is illustrated in three
case studies: The critical Slowing Down study (CSD; chapter 13), an EMA study
of suicidal ideation (the CASPAR study; chapter 15), and a study into a new GPS-
based measure of activity (the Home Range Estimation-study; chapter 16).

- Part VI provides three catalogues of EMA resources. Chapter 16 lists EMA
research groups, chapter 17 lists EMA instruments, and chapter 18 summarises R
extentions (packages) useful for EMA data analysis.
