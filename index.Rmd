# Preface {-}

Given known limitations of retrospective self-report questionnaires, such as recall bias and poor generalisability of assessment results to real-life situations, mental health researchers increasingly adopt alternative assessment methods. One of the promising alternatives is Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), in which emotions and behaviours are repeatedly sampled in everyday life, through wearable electronic devices. 

Conducting an EMA study can be a challenge. Researchers, who are new to the field, face a dazzling array of options related to the electronic wearables, outcomes selection, study design considerations, ethical and regulatory constraints, data management, statistical analysis, and study reporting. Although standards are emerging, clear guidelines for EMA research do not - at present - exist.

This research manual provides a practical introduction to EMA-research. It was written for the Amsterdam School of Public Health (APH), to aid beginning researchers looking for practical advice in conducting EMA studies. It provides an overview of EMA instruments, outcomes, methods and analytical techniques, guidelines for EMA-studies, and a catalogue of EMA research in the APH consortium.

The manual comprises six parts:

- Part I introduces EMA and R. Chapter 1 defines EMA, and discusses the opportunities and some of the challenges of EMA research. Chapter 2 introduces R, which, as this manual aims to show, is an indespensable tool for the EMA researcher.

- Part II focuses on EMA study design (chapter 3), EMA instruments (chapter 4) and EMA data management (Chapter 5).

- Part III introduces EMA data analysis techniques: Feature Extraction (chapter 6), Mixed Modelling (chapter 7), and Network Analysis (chapter 8).

- Part IV details the momentary assessment of key mental health variables: Mood (chapter 9) and Activity (chapter 10).

- In part V, the application of the preceding material is illustrated in three case studies: The critical Slowing Down study (CSD; chapter 11), an EMA pilot study of suicidal ideation (the CASPAR study; chapter 12), and a study into a new GPS-based measure of activity (the Home Range Estimation-study; chapter 13).

- Part VI provides three catalogues of EMA resources. Chapter 14 lists EMA research groups, chapter 15 lists EMA instruments, and chapter 16 summarises R extensions (packages) that are useful in EMA data analysis.
