Collection of EMA data has come a long way since the written diary. With
technological advances, current EMA data are more likely to be collected through
smart or wearable devices, connected to the internet. The various methods of EMA
are developed often from distinct assessment targets [@Shiffman2008]. For
example, a smart device will be useful for collecting data on subjective states
or behaviors, whereas wearable devices are more suited to collect physiological
data. Below are points to consider when deciding on a suitable EMA instrument,
gleaned from the past experiences of APH researchers.

## General considerations 
\index{General considerations}

### Costs new development vs known player

When considering a platform for collecting EMA data, do you choose a platform
developed by a known player or consider creating one of your own? Using a
currently available platform has its advantages but it might not have the
flexibility to meet your research needs. For example, the EMA application might
not be adapted to include items specific to your research. If you decide to
create a new platform for your study, keep time and financial resources in mind,
and make sure that you have a strong development team in place.

### Low-tech versus high-tech

Technology has greatly increased the methods of EMA data collection.
Nevertheless, it is worth considering whether your study needs to have an
advanced method of data collection. Maybe the humble written diary is sufficient
for your study needs. If so, you might save yourself from the technical
difficulties that experienced EMA researchers know all to well. Modern EMA
platforms, on the other hand, can be very efficient data collection tools that
can save the researcher and the participants a lot of time. Careful assessment
of options through field testing will give you the information you need to
decide on the most suitable data collection method.

### Access to a back-office 
\index{Back-office} 

An important consideration when deciding on an EMA platform is the autonomy
available to the researcher to set up and run the EMA study. Does the platform
include a back-office? Some EMA platforms do allow configuration or customization
to the needs of the researcher. Platforms such as MoviSens and Ilumivu, for
example, allow researchers to define items and sample schedules, enroll and
monitor participants and download the data once the study is completed (see chapter \@ref(ema-instruments-catalogue)).

```{r movisensbackoffice, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Movisens sample scheme editor (left) and App Screenshots (right)", out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center', fig.show = 'hold', fig.pos = "!h"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "images/instruments/movisens/movisens.png"))
```

### Validation and reliability

Questions can also arise regarding the validity of EMA. Items used in subjective
EMA have often not undergone rigorous psychometric testing, unlike traditional
paper questionnaires. Also, EMA software are developed using algorithms which
are not known or unavailable to the researcher to test for validity.

###  Data access

If planning on using a commercial EMA platform, it is important to clarify
whether the researcher has access to the raw data or is the data aggregated
before provision to the researcher (e.g., GENEActiv versus Fitbit). If the
researcher has access to the raw data, how easily accessible are the data? Could
the data be downloaded directly from the server of the EMA platform?

### Demands on time     

Subjective EMA can be burdensome to participants as data are collected multiple
times a day for an extended period. In order to ensure continued participation,
it is important that researchers have procedures and resources in place to
manage and assist study participants. Besides preparing a study protocol, it is
also necessary to have a manual on how to operate the EMA device. Considerable
time also needs to be invested in the training of participants; how does EMA
work, how is it implemented in the device, and what is expected from the
participant when prompts are made? The researcher might also have to factor in
the time needed to contact the participant, when data collection starts (e.g.
the following day after start of study) - to address possible problems -, or
after data collection - to debrief the participant and to assist the participant
in de-installing the app.


## Technical considerations

### Internet access
Is access to internet or WIFI an integral part of the collection process? For
example, the EMA platform does not offer an app but sends an alert with a link
to complete an online survey. This means that the participant needs to have
online access following the alert. Otherwise, this will lead to a missed data
collection. Also, if the server of the platform is down, the participant will
not be able to access the online survey following an alert.

If an app is available, would the data collected be stored locally on a device
before being uploaded to the server when in the vicinity of internet access or
WIFI?


### Device limitations

Ensure there is adequate local storage on device, in the event that uploading of
data to a central server might be hindered. EMA studies can generate a
tremendous amount of data which needs adequate storage, be it in cloud or
locally on a central server. If using cloud storage or from a commercial entity,
this raises the following questions the ownership of the server and the data,
and also the location of the server.

As EMA data could be collected using apps or in modern smartphone (e.g. GPS
tracking), a consideration would be whether to use participants' own device or
to provide a device for the study. If providing a dedicated study device, there
are upfront costs of purchasing the devices and their accessories (e.g. battery
chargers). Also, the costs of sending/returning of devices and potential loss of
device needs to be factored in.

These financial factors are a non-issue if participants use their own devices.
Instead there are other potential problems, namely that of compatibility of the
smart devices. Currently some apps are available either only on iOS or Android.
Besides considering the make of the participants device, one also needs to
consider the model. Older models might not have the feature needed for the EMA
collection. Another potential issue associated with using own devices is
adequate memory/storage capacity, i.e. to install the EMA app and collect the
data.

Regardless of using own or a dedicated device, keep in mind that apps do have
software upgrades which researchers need to be aware of and inform participants
(especially if participant is using own device).


## Participant perspective

Participating in an EMA study could impact negatively on the participant's in
his/her social environment. If using a dedicated device, participant could have
to deal with questions of the need to carry the device. This might create
feelings of stigma if the study was on a socially sensitive topic e.g.)
psychiatric well-being or suicide ideation.

Or the design of the device might not be compatible with the lifestyle of the
participant, e.g. a fashion-conscious female participant might be less than
enamored with the chunky design of a wearable activity sensor. Furthermore, the
participants have to remember to have the device on hand during the period of
data collection, sometimes even during sleep (e.g. actigraphy)

Also, in a subjective EMA study design, participants have to attend to multiple
alerts. These alerts might occur at an inconvenient social moment.


## Points to consider

  - Internet access: For example, consider 1) continuous or partial internet
    access during data collection, 2) whether participants require a certain
    amount of mobile data or access to WIFI, and 3) the required security of the
    Network used.

  - Mode of delivery 1: EMA can be collected with a designated app, or via a
    web-based questionnaire for which a notification for completion of the
    survey is send via an email or SMS.

  - Mode of delivery 2: It is possible to make use of participants’ own devices
    (fitness device, tablet, smartphone) or borrow them a designated device.

  - Choosing the right mode of delivery: Consider possible issues such as 1)
    software updates, 2) compatibility issues if using participants device, 3)
    whether EMA data needs to be stored locally (because of lack of internet
    access) before it can be uploaded to the central system and the storage
    capacity of the device this requires.

  - Stigma: Issue of “stigma” of participating in an EMA study e.g. need to
    explain the carrying/wearing of a device that might not complement
    participants’ look/lifestyle.

In a nutshell, before implementing an EMA study, it is advisable to do a pilot
study using your own device. This will allow the researcher to experience the
possible inconveniences faced by participants. And, make sure there is a Plan
B!
