### The CASPAR Project (approval 16-02-2018)
\index{CASPAR}

The Continuous Assessment for Suicide Prevention And Research (CASPAR) study (2016-2010) aims to evaluate the feasibility of mobile safety planning and daily mobile self-monitoring in routine care treatment for suicidal patients, and to conduct fundamental research on suicidal processes [@Nuij2018].

|Project team    | Dr. Wouter van Ballegooijen; Chani Nuij, MSc.; Prof.dr. Ad Kerkhof; Prof. dr Johannes Smit; Prof. dr. Heleen Riper |
|APH site        | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, VUmc, GGZ inGeest |
| Full title     | Continuous Assessment for Suicide Prevention and Research |
| Topic          | Smartphone-enabled safety planning, self-monitoring, suicide |
| Status         | Ongoing, 2016 - 2020 |
| Target population | Adult suicidal patients (N = 80) with major depression or dysthymia and suicide risk in mental health care |
| Platform used  | Ilumivu (https://ilumivu.com) |
| EMA active     | Participants are prompted 3 times a day to answer 8 self-report items (e.g. 'I feel sad'). Items are based on existing questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale, ranging from 'Not at all' to 'Very much'. Measured concepts include mood, rumination, hopelessness, defeat, entrapment, burdensomeness, belongingness, impulsiveness, suicidal imagery and suicidal ideation. Results are presented to patients in separate graphs. |
| EMA passive | Location data are gathered to indicate movement patterns and daily rhythm. Planned variables include accelerometer and smartphone usage patterns. These data are not visible to patients. |
| Data management | Patients receive a unique code to log in to the app. No names, phone numbers or other contact information are stored on the Ilumivu server. Patients are encouraged to show their graphs to their clinicians during treatment sessions. |
| Project goals | The primary objective of the CASPAR study is to test the feasibility of smartphone-based safety planning and real-time self-monitoring for patients with major depression or dysthymia and suicide risk in mental health care. Feasibility will be operationalised in terms of uptake, usage, acceptability, usability and patient satisfaction. 
| | EMA data will be used to: |
| | (a) empirically validate hypothesised psychological processes and stages of suicide pathways | 
| | (b) identify individual pathways to suicidal behaviour | 
| | (c) profile types of suicidal individuals. |
| Results | An interactive safety plan that patients can access 24/7, increased disease awareness of patients due to self-monitoring, and input for the national and international field of mental health care by sharing our results and our data, ultimately contributing to more personalised interventions according to precision medicine principles, and more effective suicide prevention. |
| Lessons learned | Constructing the right EMA items takes time. The constructs that you need to measure should be based on theory. Translate these concepts to momentary items in collaboration with EMA experts. Then test extensively among your target group|

### Study on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
\index{Chronic Fatigue}

The Study on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) focusses on CFS patients that are treated at the Expert Centre for Chronic Fatique (ECCF). The study aims to examine determinants of chronic fatigue. 

| Aspect         | Description                                                  |

| Project team | Margreet Worm-Smeitink, MSc,  .... , Prof. dr. Hans Knoop |
| APH site | AMC, Radboud UMC |
| Topic | Time series study on patients with chronic fatigue syndrome |
| Status | Completed (Period of study____) |
| Target population | Patients attending the Expert Centre for Chronic Fatigue for diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS, n = 102) |
| Platform used | RoQua (https://www.roqua.nl) |   
| EMA active | Participants were asked to complete an e-diary, 5 times a day, in a 2 week study period. Prompts were fixed in consultation with the participant, with a 3-hour break in between each. The e-diary assessed concepts such as fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, functioning (physical, mental, social), focus on fatigue, fatigue catastrophising, self-efficacy, fear avoidance, and social incomprehension. Items were scored a 5-point Likert scale |
| EMA passive | Participants contributed passive EMA data, by wearing an actimeter during the study period | 
| Data management | Participants received prompts on their smartphone, through a inviting SMS, with contained a link to the (web-based) e-diary. |
| Project goals | The objective of this study was to conduct time series analyses on fatigue, to investigate fatigue fluctuations over time. |
| Statistical methods | The R auto-var package  (see ), was used to conduct network analyses |
| Results | Determinants of fatigue will be identified with the aim of personalizing treatment of fatigue in patients with CFS. |
| Lessons learned | Think carefully beforehand which variables to include for EMA as assessing too many variables will make it difficult to determine which variables to include in model. It also makes interpretation of results difficult. Prepare clear and detailed guideline/handbook for colleagues who will assist in including participants, and be aware of potential problems with the EMA app. This is to ensure that colleagues will be motivated to include participants into the study. |


### Moodbuster and E-COMPARED (EU)
\index{Moodbuster and E-COMPARED}

E-COMPARED is an European study (EU CIP), excecuted in nine countries, comparing the costs and effects of blended treatment (combined internet, mobile and face-to-face treatment) with  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in routine and specialised mental healthcare for depression. 
Within the project, the Moodbuster application was used to gather EMA data on patient variables, such as depression and sleep. Patients were presented personalised reports on their mental and physical health over time [@Kleiboer2016]. 

| Aspect         | Description                                                  |

| Project team | Heleen Riper, PhD; Jeroen Ruwaard, PhD, Stasja Draisma, PhD., ?? |
| APH site | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, GGZ inGeest |
| Full title | Moodbuster |
| Project | Developed within the European FP7 project “ICT4Depression” |
| | Applied in Horizon 2020 FP7 EU-project “European COMPARative Effectiveness research on blended Depression treatment versus treatment-as-usual” (E-COMPARED) |
| Topic | Ecological Momentary Assessment alongside formal depression treatment |
| Status | Data collection completed (2012 – 2018) |
| Target population | Patients with Major Depressive Disorder in primary and specialized mental health care |
| Platform used | Moodbuster [http://www.ict4depression.eu/moodbuster/]. The platform is currently available in five languages: English, Dutch, German, Polish and French |
| Moodbuster | The original Moodbuster platform aimed to provide unguided self-help treatment to people with depressive symptoms. ICT4depression had 4 components: 1) physiological sensors aimed ad acceleration data and sympathetic nervous system responses (chest strap and glove), 2) a medication adherence monitor, 3) a website with treatment modules, automated feedback messages and tools (calendar, mood graph, sensor chart, ratings), and 4) Moodbuster (Android) app for access to treatment modules and mood ratings, location and activity tracking, and aggregation of physiological sensors |
| E-COMPARED | Within the E-COMPARED study, the Moodbuster website and application were used. A therapist portal was added, in order to allow therapists to monitor patients’ progress and send feedback messages. |
| EMA active | Patients rated 7 items on a visual analogue scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (low) to 10 (high). Concepts that were measured, included: sleep, mood, worrying, self-esteem, activities (2 items) and social contacts. Items focused on current state, for example by asking “How is your mood right now”. 
| EMI | The platform sent out automated reminders for scheduled activities within the modules and therapist appointments and tailored automated motivational text messages. The aim of EMI was to keep patients engaged with Moodbuster (rate mood and log in on platform). |
| Data management | Patients and therapists accessed the platform with a personalized log-in. Mood was assessed daily at a random time point between 10:00 and 22:00. During the first and last 7 days of treatment, Sleep, Worrying and Self-esteem items were assessed in the morning (around 10:00). In the evening (around 22:00) these questions were repeated, along with the Activity and Social contact items. Patient data was stored on a server under a unique participant ID number. Patients with an iPhone were offered an android phone for the duration of EMA. |

### FAntasTIGUE
\index{FAntasTIGUE}

The FAntasTIGUE study examines fatigue in patients with COPD, by evaluating the course of fatigue, precipitating/perpetuating factors and hospitalisation. A secondary aim is to identify diurnal (happening during the day rather than at night) differences in fatigue by using EMA [@Goertz2018].

| Status | Ongoing, 2017-2020 |
| Target population | Patients with clinically stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (proposed: n=60) |
| Platform used | Psymate (https://psymate.eu) |
| Study design | Longitudinal with 4 data collection periods (baseline, 4, 8, 12 months) |  
| EMA active | For each data collection period, participants are prompted 8 times a day at random moments between 7.30am and 22.30pm, for 5 consecutive days, to answer 19 items (including 9 contextual items). Measured concepts include fatigue, feeling relaxed, breathlessness, agitation, uncertainty, irritation, satisfaction, anxiety, feeling energetic, and feeling mentally fit. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale, ranging from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Very much’. In addition, participants are asked to complete a morning questionnaire soon after awakening to assess the quality of their sleep the previous night. Participants also complete an evening questionnaire assessing the general perception of their day just before going to bed | | EMA Passive | During the collection period of self-reported data, patients are asked to wear an actigraph (activity monitor) for 7 days for 24 hours a day |
| Data management | During the data collection period, patients are provided with iPods installed with the EMA application |
| Project goals | To capture possible diurnal fluctuations in fatigue. |
| Results | Future results will guide the development of interventions for the management of fatigue in this patient group |
| Lessons learned | |

### MERITS (approval summary 12-03-2018)

The Momentary assessment of patient Experiences in Real life of Insulin Glargine 300 in Type 1 diabetes (MERITS) Study aims to 1) evaluate whether blood glucose variability is associated with changes in wellbeing (mood) during waking time, and 2) assess whether there are individual differences (profiles) with regard to this association.

| Full title | MERITS - Momentary assessment of patient Experiences in Real life of Insulin Glargine 300 in Type 1 diabetes Study |
| Topic | Type 1 diabetes, relationship between blood glucose variability (continuous glucose measurement) and changes in mood and energy. | 
| Status | Ongoing proof-of-concept study, 2018 - 2020 |
| Target population | Adult patients (N=70) with type 1 diabetes |
| Platform used | Illumivu |
| EMA | Currently under development. Participants will be (randomly) prompted to answer questions on mood (based on POMS questionnaire), diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycaemia and sleep. |
| Project goals | Explore whether a) blood glucose variability (SD and CV) is related to changes in wellbeing (mood) during waking time, b) if switching to U-300 results in less glucose variability and translates into improved mood over time within patients, c) explore if individual differences (profiles) can be distinguished with regard to the (strength of the) association between glucose variability and changes in mood. |


### NESDA EMA Diary Study
\index{NESDA}

The main aim of NESDA (the Netherlands study of Anxiety and Depression) is to examine the long-term (eight-year) prognosis and co-morbidity of anxiety and depression in order to improve quality of care and prevent chronicity (https://www.nesda.nl/). Within the NESDA study, EMA was used to assess a variety of research questions, concerning topics such as the dynamic interplay between cognitions, emotions, behavior and environment in daily life of individuals, the feasibility of EMA in participants with affective disorders, and chronotype and diurnal patterns of activity in depressed versus non-depressed participants. 

| Aspect         | Description                                                  |

| Project team | Femke Lamers, PhD, Brenda Penninx, PhD |
| APH site | VUmc, GGZ inGeest |
| Full title | the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), Wave 6 diary study |
| Topic | Momentary assessment of people with depressive symptoms |
| Status | Completed, 2015 - 2017 |
| Target population | Selected sample of NESDA participants with symptoms of depression and healthy controls |
| Platform used | RoQua (https://www.roqua.nl/). Participants were prompted with a SMS, which contained a link to the EMA questions | 
| EMA active | The self-report questionnaire contained circa 31 items. Items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 'not [at all]' to 'very'. Participants were prompted five times a day, for two weeks. Contructs of interest were 1) valance (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal (calm to excited), 2) current state, symptoms of depression/anxiety, physical condition, 3) social context, 4) sleep, 5) daily uplifts/hassels, 6) activities, and 7) substance use. Examples of items were: "I feel down", "I feel cheerful" and "Where are you now" (e.g. at the neighbour's house). In addition, there was an addendum questionnaire with one item inquiring about questionnaire burden and an open ended question for general comments on circumstances that might influence answers. 
| Origin of items | The items on valance, arousal and current state have been used in a previous study; the Uncovering the Positive Potential of Emotional Reactivity (UPPER) study (@Bennik2015). The other items are inspired on earlier EMA studies, such as the work by Mehl and colleagues (@Mehl2012), van Os and colleagues (@Wichers2012) and studies performed at the Interdisciplinary Center of Psychopathology and Emotion regulation (ICPE), such as the Mood and Movement in Daily life (MOOVD) study (@Booij2015) |
| Data management | EMA started within 31 days after the regular NESDA assessments (face-to-face interview and self-report measures). Participants could use their own smartphone if they had sufficient data, or access to WiFi for at least 80% of the two-week time period. If participants did not have a smartphone, they could borrow one. Patients were briefed on the EMA study during a face-to-face session with a research assistant (following standard NESDA data 9-year follow-up assessment). Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire within 15 minutes after the SMS. After 30 minutes a reminder was sent, and after 60 minutes the link would become inactive. Participants needed to answer all questions before the questionnaire could be send to the secured server. Participants received personalised mood fluctiuation reports, in order to motivate them to adhere to EMA. Reports were sent via e-mail in a password protected document. During data collection, patients were contacted by a research assistant after 24 hours and 7 days in order to enquire whether problems had occurred with EMA. Research assistants actively monitored data collection and contacted participants if they missed three consecutive questionnaires. Data were stored in a secured web-environment of the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) |
| EMA passive | In order to record the amount of physical activity during EMA monitoring, participants were asked to wear an accelerometer (GENEActiv) on their non-dominant wrist 24 hours a day for two weeks. Recording started on the evening prior to the first EMA assessment and continued until the morning after the last assessment. After data collection, participants mailed their watch to the research center. Data was extracted via a USB with GENEActiv software. |
| Results | EMA data will be used to assess a variety of research questions, concerning topics such as the dynamic interplay between cognitions, emotions, behavior and environment in daily life of individuals, the feasibility of EMA in participants with affective disorders, chronotype and diurnal patterns of activity in depressed versus non-depressed participants, and MDD subtypes. |

### Project RADAR-CNS (EU)
\index{RADAR-CNS}

The European (EU H2020-IMI) RADAR-CNS project (Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System) aims to study the potential of wearable devices and smartphone technology to help prevent and treat depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy (https://www.radar-cns.org/). The Dutch research site (VUmc/GGZ inGeest) will focus on depression. 

| Aspect         | Description                                                  |

| Dutch project team| Femke Lamers, PhD, Brenda Penninx, PhD, Sonia Difrancesco  |
| APH site | VUmc, GGZ inGeest |
| Context | The project is jointly led by King's College London and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV. The project is funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a Public Private Partnership set up between the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and the European Union). It includes 23 organizations from across Europe and the US. |
| Full title | RADAR-CNS: Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System |
| Topic | Wearable devices to help prevent and treat depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy |
| Status | Ongoing, 2016 |
| Target populations | Patients with major depressive disorder, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis (MS) |
| Platform | RMT application (http://thehyve.nl/cases/radar-cns/) |
| Project goals | Examine how remote measurement technologies can monitor and improve quality of life and psychological well-being for people with depression, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis |
| Technical goals | 1) Build an end-to-end system with generalized data aggregation capabilities. The platform focuses on classes of data rather than specific devices, in order to enhance modularity and adaptability as new devices become available. The platform is delivered under an Apache 2 open source license, 2) Big data solutions. |
| Clinical goals | 1) Continuous monitoring of patients, 2) predicting disease onset or relapse (prevention and risk assessment) |
| EMA active | aRMT application: Outcomes include variability in sleep quality, levels of activity, social interactions, mood, cognitive performance and stress as possible predictors of clinical course. |
| EMA passive | pRMT application: 1) Location and movement (GPS) 2) Mood: voice recognition) 3) Social interaction (call and message logs), and 4) App interaction and app usage. 
| Wearables | Skin temperature, heart rate (-variability), actigraphy (3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope), galvanic skin conductance (Empatica E4 Wristband, Pebble 2 Smartwatch, Biovotion VSM, Faros 180, and Fitbit devices). In the depression study a Fitbit will be used to measure sleep and activity. | 
| Data management | Participants are requested to install three apps on their Android smartphone. Data is collected during a 2-year period. Active EMA will be activated every 6 weeks for 6 consecutive days. Four times per year a non-EMA follow-up is conducted, which contains (qualitative) interviews and self-report questionnaires. Log in is facilitated with token-based authentication and authorization. A dashboard app allows for live monitoring of results. Data is streamed and analysed live. |
| Results | GGZ inGeest will participate in the depression study as a research site. Data will be used to assess a variety of research questions, concerning topics such as MDD subtypes, seasonal depression and predicting relapse |
| Lessons learned | When measuring over such a long time span, extra attention should be paid to the possible burden for participants. Continuous monitoring via a Smartphone can severely impact battery life. Participants prefer consumer devices (such as FitBit) rather than research devices (such as GenActiv), because of stigma. Carrying a research device will prompt questions. |

| Topics | Psychosis, auditory hallucinations, social participation in people with schizophrenia.|  
| Project title | Temstem |
| Project team | Mark van der Gaag, PhD; Alyssa Jongeneel, MSc; David van den Berg, PhD; Dorien Scheffers, MSc |
| APH site | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, VUmc, GGZ inGeest, Parnassia Psychiatric Institute
| Status | Ongoing, March 2016- July 2018 |
| Target population | People who suffer from hearing voices and are obstructed by them in their daily life |
| Platform | Temstem application. Developed by Reframing Studio, in collaboration with Parnassia Psychiatric Institute and TU Delft. Available for IOS and Android |
| EMI | Mobile application (Temstem) focuses on reducing distress and dysfunction caused by auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). Components:  1) coping: addressing verbal working memory phonological loop with a language task, thereby blocking the hearing of voices, 2) positive reinforcement: decreasing self-reported negative self-esteem themes, 3) treatment: reducing emotional response to memories associated with voices by taxing the auditory working memory during recall of negative auditory memories (as in EMDR therapy).
| EMA active | Users are encouraged to fill-in 9 self-report items on a daily basis. Outcomes include: 1) hearing voices: 6 items (e.g. "Today, the voices were disturbing"), 2) mood, 3) self-esteem, 4) the use of Temstem ("I used Temstem today"). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale. Items are based on existing EMA questionnaires. Results are presented to users in separate graphs, in order to support users in gaining insight in the pattern of AVH over time, or after use of Temstem. |
| Project goals | Examine the effect of the app on distress and dysfunction in a RCT. Investigate the effect of Temstem on frequency and severity of AVH, to determine working mechanisms, to identify predictors and mediators of effects, and to test the usability of Temstem. |
| Results | Reduce distress and dysfunction caused by auditory verbal hallucinations |
| Data management| Data is stored on a server hosted by Service Heroes (via Reframing Studio), under users' unique download numbers. Stored variables include, among others, scores of vividness of AVH pre and post use of Temstem, data on application use (duration), used function (e.g. 'Silencing' function which focuses on coping, or 'Challenging' function which is based on dual tasking), and how users feel when they hear voices. Users can choose to provide additional information on age, gender, which county in the Netherlands they are currently located, how they found the app, and why they want to use it (e.g. because they hear voices, because they are a clinician and they want to learn more about the app to support clients, etc.). Clinicians cannot access user data or graphs. Researchers can, but only in big data files. To see users' personal data (e.g. how many times they used the app, how vivid the voices were before and after the use of Temstem, etc.) researchers need the users' unique download number. |
| Lessons learned | Users need internet to use the app, because it works on an online platform. However, not all our users have wireless internet. If we had known this in time, we would have chosen to run it offline. Other lessons we have learned are that you have to resolve bugs as soon as possible, because otherwise it may take a long time before it is fixed. Be very explicit in what you want and expect from the app developers, even when you think that it is quite logic and clear. |

| Study information | EMA data was collected as part of a RCT comparing treatment as usual plus virtual reality therapy (VR-CBT) to treatment as usual for outpatients suffering from a psychotic disorder and paranoid ideation. EMA was used to assess the primary outcome social participation. |
| EMA active | 1) Anxiety (1 item, e.g. "I feel anxious"), 2) Perceived social threat (4 items, e.g. "In this company, I feel accepted"), 3) Paranoia (3 items, e.g. "I feel suspicious"), and 4) Time spent with others (max. 3 multiple choice items inquiring about type of company (nobody, family, non-family, etc.). Patients were prompted 10 times a day, during 6 days. Anxiety, threat and paranoia Items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ("not at all") to 7 ("very"). Reports had to be completed within 15 min of the beep. EMA items were used in previous studies (Collip et al., 2010). |
| Data management |To be included in the analysis, participants had to complete diary entries for at least one-third of the beeps (i.e., a minimum of 20 measurements). Because the PsyMate application was not finished at the time of the trial, participants were provided with a small palmtop device for the duration of EMA. Data was extracted with 4D software. Time spent with others was defined as the percentage of time participants were in company of others (excluding mental health care professionals). Other EMA measurements were only used when a participant reported being in a social situation. Information was stored on the PsyMate server, under a user-specific PsyMate-ID number. Researchers had access to a file matching study-ID to PsyMate-ID numbers, which allowed matching of information acquired via EMA with information acquired with regular self-report measures during the RCT study. |
| Project goals | Testing the effects of virtual-reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) on paranoid thoughts and social participation via momentary assessment |
| Results | All 116 participants completed EMA measurements at baseline (mean number of completed self-assessments 46.1, SD 13.3), 96 participants completed the post-treatment assessment sufficiently (43.1, SD 10.1), and 87 participants completed the follow-up (43.2, SD 11.1). The trial results suggest that the addition of VR-CBT to standard treatment can reduce paranoid ideation and momentary anxiety in patients with a psychotic disorder. |
| Lessons learned | Participants reported not wanting to explain to others why they were using the palmtop (a small black hand-held computer) as a reason for non-compliance with EMA. This directly interfered with the primary aim, namely assessing social context. An app facilitates measurement without the participant having to explain to others what they are doing |

| APH site | Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam |
| Full title | VU University Monitoring System (VU-AMS) |
| Topic | Wearable for passive (non-evasive) ambulatory measurement of the autonomic nervous system for research purposes |
| Status | Ongoing (1990 - present) |
| Target population | Various target populations |
|EMA passive | Heart Rate / Inter beat Interval (IBI), Heart Rate Variability (SDNN, RMSSD, IBI power spectrum: HF, LF), Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), Pre-Ejection Period (PEP), Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), Respiration Rate (RR), Stroke Volume (SV) and Cardiac Output (CO), Skin Conductance Level (SCL) and Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs), Tri-Axial Accelerometry (Body Movement). The VU-AMS device is battery powered and can record 24 to 48 hours of data (4GB storage). Data is extracted with infrared to USB |
| Data management | Users do not have access to data. The Data Analysis and Management System (DAMS) is used for data extraction and processing. The DAMS tool offers options for data inspection (visual inspection of raw data), automated detection of R-peaks in raw ECG signal and visual inspection of final IBI time series, labelling data, IBI spectral power calculation, automated scoring of parasympathetic tone (respiration scoring), impedance scoring and data export per label (to EXCEL or ASCII) http://www.vu-ams.nl/support/downloads/software/.|
| Current VU-AMS projects | Validation of the Philips EmoGraphy technology to measure sympathetic nervous system activity in an ambulatory setting (van der Mee et al., ongoing, 2017 - 2021). |
|EMA passive| Wearable, which measures combined skin conductance and heart rate variability. Information on current stress situation is presented as a Stress Level Score to the user, alongside a one-hour prediction of changes in stress level and cognitive functioning (Cognitive Zone changes). |
| Results | The project aims to validate EmoGraphy by XXX (methods). The technology aims to "provide actionable insights that allow users to manage their emotional and physical stress so they can perform in the optimal cognitive zone in their daily activities" http://www.ip.philips.com/licensing/program/121.

| Full title | Improving the conceptualisation and measurement of quality of life of patients with multiple chronic morbidities, exemplified by patients with cardiac disease undergoing cardiac intervention |
| Topic | Smartphone data collection |
| Status | Ongoing, 2016-2010 |
| Target population | Cardiac patients with comorbidities who were scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (N= 37 EMA /320 total) |
| Platform used |Psymate (https://psymate.eu)|
| Study design | Longitudinal with three EMA data collection periods (1. pre-treatment, 2. two weeks after treatment for PCI patients or 3 months post-treatment for CABG patients, and 3. six months post-treatment) |
| EMA active | Participants are prompted to answer nine general and one evening questionnaire per day for seven consecutive days. During the day, patients are beeped randomly between 7.30 and 22.30 hours to complete the general questionnaire. The general questionnaire contains 19 items, including 5 contextual items. Concepts measured include: positive mood (feeling energetic, relaxed feeling, cheerfulness, happy), negative mood (anxiety, sadness, irritation, worry), coronary artery disease symptoms (chest pain, tightness in chest, oppressive feeling on the chest), and general symptoms (tiredness, other types of pain, shortness of breath). Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale, ranging from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Very much’. Patients were asked to complete the evening questionnaire just before they went to bed. The evening questionnaire had, besides the general questionnaire, an additional set of questions from the EQ-5D, and the health state of that day. The last item is rated on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) |
| Data management | Participants were provided with iPods installed with the EMA application during data collection. Or if they preferred, could use their own device. |
| Project goals | The project aims to get a better understanding of the moment-to-moment changes in quality of life and how this compares with changes found in retrospective QoL measurements. The project aims to compare QoL collected retrospectively through online or paper surveys with that collected via EMA. Data collected through EMA can also inform possible changes in daily QoL, taking contextual situations into account  |
| Project goals | The project aims to compare QoL collected retrospectively through paper surveys with that collected via EMA. Data collected through EMA can also inform possible changes in daily QoL, taking contextual situations into account. Data will be analysed using vector autoregressive models using R|
| Results | Work in progress, currently exploring the data using network analysis. 
Lessons learned | To maintain response during follow-ups, it is important to maintain contact with patients between follow-ups. The development and testing of the app can take a significant amount of time, and during the study, updates of the smartphone operating system may lead to new bugs in the app. Due to the amount of data collected via EMA, data cleaning can take up a significant amount of time. The quality of EMA data can be low due to significant amount of missing data. Besides missing data, lack of variation in answers from day-to-day (through use of a Likert scale) could also be an issue. Possible solution is the use of continuous rating scales instead of 7-point Likert scales Both missing data and lack of variation can be a problem if planning to estimate vector autoregressive models.  |
