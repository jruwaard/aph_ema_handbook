### The CASPAR Project

Project team: Wouter van Ballegooijen, PhD; Chani Nuij, MSc; Ad Kerkhof, PhD; Jan Smit, PhD; Heleen Riper, PhD 
APH site: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, VUmc, GGZ inGeest
Full title: Continuous Assessment for Suicide Prevention and Research
Topic: Smartphone-enabled safety planning, self-monitoring, suicide
Status: Ongoing, 2016 - 2020
Target population: Adult suicidal patients (N=80) with major depression or dysthymia and suicide risk in mental health care
Platform used: Ilumivu (https://ilumivu.com)  
EMA active: Participants are prompted 3 times a day to answer 8 self-report items (e.g. 'I feel sad'). Items are based on existing questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale, ranging from 'Not at all' to 'Very much'. Measured concepts include mood, rumination, hopelessness, defeat, entrapment, burdensomeness, belongingness, impulsiveness, suicidal imagery and suicidal ideation. Results are presented to patients in separate graphs. 
EMA passive: Location data are gathered to indicate movement patterns and daily rhythm. 
Planned variables include accelerometer and smartphone usage patterns. These data are not visible to patients.
Data management: Patients receive a unique code to log in to the app. No names, phone numbers or other contact information are stored on the Ilumivu server. Patients are encouraged to show their graphs to their clinicians during treatment sessions. 
Project goals: The primary objective of the CASPAR study is to test the feasibility of smartphone-based safety planning and real-time self-monitoring for patients with major depression or dysthymia and suicide risk in mental health care. Feasibility will be operationalised in terms of uptake, usage, acceptability, usability and patient satisfaction. EMA data will be used to (a) empirically validate hypothesised psychological processes and stages of suicide pathways, (b) identify individual pathways to suicidal behaviour, and (c) profile types of suicidal individuals.
Results: An interactive safety plan that patients can access 24/7, increased disease awareness of patients due to self-monitoring, and input for the national and international field of mental health care by sharing our results and our data, ultimately contributing to more personalised interventions according to precision medicine principles, and more effective suicide prevention.
Lessons learned and advice for other researchers: Constructing the right EMA items takes time. The constructs that you need to measure should be based on theory. Translate these concepts to momentary items in collaboration with EMA experts. Then test extensively among your target group.

The project is jointly led by King's College London and Janssen Pharmaceutica NV. The project is funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a Public Private Partnership set up between the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and the European Union). It includes 23 organizations from across Europe and the US. 
Full title: RADAR-CNS: Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System
Topic: Wearable devices to help prevent and treat depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy
Status: Ongoing, XXX-
Target populations: Patients with major depressive disorder, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Project goals: Examine how remote measurement technologies can monitor and improve quality of life and psychological well-being for people with depression, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis. Technical goals: 1) Built an end-to-end system with generalized data aggregation capabilities. The platform focuses on classes of data rather than specific devices, in order to enhance modularity and adaptability as new devices become available. The platform is delivered under an Apache 2 open source license. 2) Big data solutions.
Clinical goals: 1) Continuous monitoring of patients, 2) predicting disease onset or relapse (prevention and risk assessment) 
EMA passive: Android smartphone sensors: 1) Location and movement (GPS), 2) Mood: voice recognition), 3) Social interaction (call and message logs), 4) App interaction and app usage. Wearables: Skin temperature, heart rate (-variability), actigraphy (3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope), galvanic skin conductance (Empatica E4 Wristband, Pebble 2 Smartwatch, Biovotion VSM, Faros 180, and Fitbit devices). 
EMA active: EMA questionnaires via pRMT application, which was built with Cordova. Outcomes include variability in sleep quality, levels of activity, social interactions, mood, cognitive performance and stress as possible predictors of clinical course. 
Data management: token-based authentication and authorization. A dashboard app allows for live monitoring of results. Data is streamed and analyzed live.

### NESDA EMA

NESDA diary study 
Project team: Femke Lamers, Phd 
APH site: VUmc, GGZ inGeest
Full title: the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), Wave 6 diary study 
Topic: Momentary assessment of people with depressive symptoms
Status: 2015 - 2017
Target population: NESDA participants with symptoms of depression and healthy controls
Platform used: RoQua (https://www.roqua.nl/) 
EMA active: Outcomes included: 
1) Valance and arousal (2 items, "I'm feeling ...") which were scored on Likert scales ranging from very unpleasant to very pleasant and very calm to very excited; 
2) Current state (12 items, "I feel relaxed", "I feel down", "I feel cheerful"), symptoms of depression/anxiety (4 items, "I worry a lot", "I am able to concentrate well", and bodily experiences (2 items, "I feel tired") scored on 7-point Linkert scales ranging from 1 (not) to 7 (very)
3) social contact (2 items, "Where are you now" (e.g. at the neighbour's house), "In who's company are you now") and a follow-up question (1 item, "I would rather have had company" or "I experience my company as being …" (unpleasant - pleasant))
4) Sleep (3 items on sleep quality and duration)
5) (Un)pleasant every day experiences, when rated with yes, participants were asked to elaborate (3 items on intensity, importance and internal or external cause). 
5) Activities (1 multiple-choice item, including social interaction, additional (eating) and other (exercise)
6) Smoking, coffee and alcohol (number of units)
7) Eating (1 item at final daily prompt, "Did you eat more of less than usual") 
8) Burden (1 item, "How disrupting was it to fill in this questionnaire"
9) Open ended question for general comments on circumstances that might influence answers.  
Participants were prompted five times a day, for two weeks. Prompts consisted of a SMS, which contained a link to the EMA questions. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire within 15 minutes after the SMS. After 30 minutes a reminder was sent, and after 60 minutes the link would become inactive. Each questionnaire contained circa 35 items. 
Data management: EMA started within 31 days after the regular NESDA assessments (face-to-face interview and self-report measures). Participants could use their own smartphone if they had sufficient data, or access to WiFi for at least 80% of the two-week time period. If participants did not have a smartphone, they could borrow a phone. 
Patients were briefed on the EMA study during a face-to-face session with a research assistant (following standard NESDA data 9-year follow-up assessment). In order to motivate participants to adhere to EMA, they were shown two examples of mood fluctuation reports, one with a 43% compliance rate and one with a 96% compliance rate. Personalized reports were sent via e-mail in a password protected document. During data collection, patients were contacted by a research assistant after 24 hours and 7 days in order to enquire whether problems had occurred with EMA. Research assistants actively monitored data collection and contacted participants if they missed three consecutive questionnaires. Data were stored in a secured web-environment of the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG).
EMA passive: Alongside active EMA, participants were asked to wear a actigraph watch (GENEActiv) on their non-dominant wrist 24 hours a day for two weeks. After data collection, participants mailed their watch to the research center. Data was extracted via a USB with XXX software. 
Results: EMA data will be used to assess a variety of research questions, such as the dynamic network structure of affective and somatic symptoms, interpersonal functioning in depression, feasibility of EMA in participants with affective disorders, chronotype and diurnal patterns of activity in depressed versus non-depressed participants, and MDD subtypes.

### Mark van der Gaag group

### VRETp trial

Project: Effect of virtual reality exposure therapy on social participation in people with a psychotic disorder (VRETp)
Project team: Mark van der Gaag, PhD; Roos Pot-Kolder, MSc; Wim Veiling; Chris Geraets
APH site: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, VUmc, UMC Groningen
Status: Completed, 2013-2016
Target population: Patients (n=116) with psychotic disorders who fear social situations.
Platform: PsyMate (http://www.psymate.eu/)
Study information: EMA data was collected as part of a RCT comparing treatment as usual plus virtual reality therapy (VR-CBT) to treatment as usual for outpatients suffering from a psychotic disorder and paranoid ideation. EMA was used to assess the primary outcome social participation. 
EMA active: 
1) Anxiety (1 item, e.g. "I feel anxious")
2) Perceived social threat (4 items, e.g. "In this company, I feel accepted")
3) Paranoia (3 items, e.g. "I feel suspicious")
4) Time spent with others (max. 3 multiple choice items inquiring about type of company (nobody, family, non-family, etc.). 
Patients were prompted 10 times a day, during 6 days. Anxiety, threat and paranoia Items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ("not at all") to 7 ("very"). Reports had to be completed within 15 min of the beep. EMA items were used in previous studies (Collip et al., 2010).  
Data management: To be included in the analysis, participants had to complete diary entries for at least one-third of the beeps (i.e., a minimum of 20 measurements). Because the PsyMate application was not finished at the time of the trial, participants were provided with a small palmtop device for the duration of EMA. Data was extracted with 4D software. Time spent with others was defined as the percentage of time participants were in company of others (excluding mental health care professionals). Other EMA measurements were only used when a participant reported being in a social situation. Information was stored on the PsyMate server, under a user-specific PsyMate-ID number. Researchers had access to a file matching study-ID to PsyMate-ID numbers, which allowed matching of information acquired via EMA with information acquired with regular self-report measures during the RCT study. 
Project goals: Testing the effects of virtual-reality-based cognitive behavioural therapy (VR-CBT) on paranoid thoughts and social participation via momentary assessment.
Results: All 116 participants completed EMA measurements at baseline (mean number of completed self-assessments 46.1, SD 13.3), 96 participants completed the post-treatment assessment sufficiently (43.1, SD 10.1), and 87 participants completed the follow-up (43.2, SD 11.1). The trial results suggest that the addition of VR-CBT to standard treatment can reduce paranoid ideation and momentary anxiety in patients with a psychotic disorder.
Lessons learned and advice for other researchers: Participants reported not wanting to explain to others why they were using the palmtop (a small black hand-held computer) as a reason for non-compliance with EMA. This directly interfered with the primary aim, namely assessing social context. An app facilitates measurement without the participant having to explain to others what they are doing.  
Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN12929657. Date of registration: 8 September 2015.

### TemStem

Team Mark van der Gaag
Topics: Psychosis, auditory hallucinations, social participation in people with schizophrenia.  
Project title: Temstem
Project team: Mark van der Gaag, PhD; Alyssa Jongeneel, MSc; David van den Berg, PhD; Dorien Scheffers, MSc
APH site: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, VUmc, GGZ inGeest, Parnassia Psychiatric Institute
Status: Ongoing, March 2016- July 2018
Target population: People who suffer from hearing voices and are obstructed by them in their daily life
Platform used: Temstem application. Developed by Reframing Studio, in collaboration with Parnassia Psychiatric Institute and TU Delft.
EMI: Mobile application (Temstem) focuses on reducing distress and dysfunction caused by auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). Components: 
1) coping: addressing verbal working memory phonological loop with a language task, thereby blocking the hearing of voices
2) positive reinforcement: decreasing self-reported negative self-esteem themes
3) treatment: reducing emotional response to memories associated with voices by taxing the auditory working memory during recall of negative auditory memories (as in EMDR therapy).
EMA: Users are encouraged to fill-in 9 self-report items on a daily basis. Outcomes: 
1) hearing voices: 6 items (e.g. "Today, the voices were disturbing")
2) mood: 1 item ("I felt depressed")
3) self-esteem: 1 item ("I was satisfied about myself")
4) the use of Temstem ("I used Temstem today"). 
Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-scale. Items are based on existing EMA questionnaires. Results are presented to users in separate graphs, in order to support users in gaining insight in the pattern of AVH over time, or after use of Temstem. 
Project goals: Examine the effect of the app on distress and dysfunction in a RCT. Investigate the effect of Temstem on frequency and severity of AVH, to determine working mechanisms, to identify predictors and mediators of effects, and to test the usability of Temstem.
Results: Reduce distress and dysfunction caused by auditory verbal hallucinations
Data management: Data is stored on a server hosted by Service Heroes (via Reframing Studio), under users' unique download numbers. Stored variables include, among others, scores of vividness of AVH pre and post use of Temstem, data on application use (duration), used function (e.g. 'Silencing' function which focuses on coping, or 'Challenging' function which is based on dual tasking), and how users feel when they hear voices. Users can choose to provide additional information on age, gender, which county in the Netherlands they are currently located, how they found the app, and why they want to use it (e.g. because they hear voices, because they are a clinician and they want to learn more about the app to support clients, etc.). Clinicians cannot access user data or graphs. Researchers can, but only in big data files. To see users' personal data (e.g. how many times they used the app, how vivid the voices were before and after the use of Temstem, etc.) researchers need the users' unique download number. 
Lessons learned and advice for other researchers: Users need internet to use the app, because it works on an online platform. However, not all our users have wireless internet. If we had known this in time, we would have chosen to run it offline. Other lessons we have learned are that you have to resolve bugs as soon as possible, because otherwise it may take a long time before it is fixed. Be very explicit in what you want and expect from the app developers, even when you think that it is quite logic and clear.

APH site: VUmc, AMC
Full title: MERITS - Momentary assessment of patient Experiences in Real life of Insulin Glargine 300 in Type 1 diabetes Study
Topic: Type 1 diabetes, relationship between blood glucose variability (continuous glucose measurement) and changes in mood and energy. 
Status: Ongoing proof-of-concept study, 2018 - 2020
Target population: Adult patients (N=70) with type 1 diabetes 
Platform used: Illumivu
EMA: Currently under development. Participants will be (randomly) prompted to answer questions on mood (based on POMS questionnaire), diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycaemia and sleep. 
Project goals: Explore whether a) blood glucose variability (SD and CV) is related to changes in wellbeing (mood) during waking time, b) if switching to U-300 results in less glucose variability and translates into improved mood over time within patients, c) explore if individual differences (profiles) can be distinguished with regard to the (strength of the) association between glucose variability and changes in mood.
